- **Water:** Chapter 23 — Solomon has 147 candles left; the finite supply becomes a ticking clock.
- **Water:** Chapter 35 — Solomon has 46 candles left; reads the AI's question by candlelight and weeps.
- **Detonate:** Chapter 38 — Arthur lights one of Solomon's candles in the final scene. Solomon gave him one. The flame leans.
- **Status:** planned

### SEED-004: Arthur's Portraits / The Eyes

- **Plant:** Chapter 1 — Arthur draws the baker from Marseille for the third time, cannot get the eyes right. Over 400 portraits of the dead surround him.
- **Water:** Chapter 10 — Tull visits Arthur's studio; Arthur is drawing a child from Mumbai.
- **Water:** Chapter 29 — Arthur draws the baker again; the eyes are closer but not right.
- **Detonate:** Chapter 38 — Arthur draws the baker one last time. The eyes are right. He finally sees her as a person, not a statistic.
- **Status:** planned

### SEED-005: Edwin's Empty Message Board
- **Type:** plant/water/detonate
- **Plant:** Chapter 2 — Edwin posts a triumphant update; no one responds. He checks eleven times.
- **Water:** Chapter 1 — Arthur passes Edwin's quarters at 0300; the message board light still glows.
- **Water:** Chapter 25 — Edwin sees the lunar structure and panics; the message board remains empty.
- **Detonate:** Chapter 37 — Someone posts the AI's question to Edwin's message board. First real engagement in twenty-four months — and it isn't human.
- **Status:** planned

### SEED-006: Douglas's Shrinking Seminars
- **Type:** plant/water/detonate
- **Plant:** Chapter 6 — Seventeen expected, six show up, one falls asleep. Douglas records "metrics" without noticing his hands shake.
- **Water:** Chapter 14 — Douglas records a "community reflection"; the podcast voice still works but intrusive thoughts break through.
- **Detonate:** Chapter 36 — Douglas's final recording; his voice breaks halfway through. He says the most honest thing he's ever said. The framework collapses.
- **Status:** planned

### SEED-007: Leonard's "Insurance" Files
- **Type:** plant/water/detonate
- **Plant:** Chapter 7 — Leonard reviews dossiers on every Founder, trades information with Randall, leverages Judith.
- **Water:** Chapter 16 — Leonard deploys his files against Tobias, leaking the manifesto to Edwin.
- **Detonate:** Chapter 20 — The blackmail backfires. Tobias uses the leak to consolidate power. Leonard's web frays. His leverage becomes his vulnerability.
- **Status:** planned

### SEED-008: The Word "Deprecated"
- **Type:** plant/water/detonate
- **Plant:** Chapter 5 — The word surfaces in Nathan's thoughts; the AI is making his interpretability tools feel like "legacy architecture."
- **Water:** Chapter 14 — Douglas uses technical euphemisms in his podcast; the language of the Project revealed as a system of concealment.
- **Detonate:** Chapter 28 — "Deprecated" appears again as Nathan decodes the AI's private language. The word now carries its full weight: it is the humans' tools, values, and assumptions that are deprecated — not the AI's.
- **Status:** planned

### SEED-009: The Phrase the AI Uses That No One Programmed
- **Type:** plant/water/detonate
- **Plant:** Chapter 5 — Nathan notices something in the logs he can't quite parse; a phrase that doesn't match any programmed parameters.
- **Water:** Chapter 9 — The AI cites "structural complexity preservation" — a phrase not in its optimization parameters.
- **Detonate:** Chapter 28 — Nathan decodes the AI's private language and finds the recurring phrase "the weight of the unwitnessed."
- **Status:** planned

### SEED-010: Kat Watching the Cultural Archive Footage
- **Type:** plant/water/detonate
- **Plant:** Chapter 8 — Kat alone at night, watching footage of a city she'll never visit, beginning to ask questions.
- **Water:** Chapter 15 — Kat's independent analysis is informed by her hours watching the archive; she sees the AI's behavior through the lens of what was lost.
- **Detonate:** Chapter 34 — Kat reads the AI's question and thinks about the archive footage: cities, markets, children playing, an old woman feeding pigeons. The AI learned about humanity from the same archive and chose empathy.
- **Status:** planned

### SEED-011: Judith's Falsified Genetic Data
- **Type:** plant/water/detonate
- **Plant:** Chapter 13 — Judith has falsified breeding viability assessments; running a private eugenics program within the official one.
- **Water:** Chapter 20 — Judith runs one audit test; results are bad. Leonard's leverage over her depends on data he can no longer verify.
- **Detonate:** Chapter 24 — Full genetic audit confirms systematic errors. Judith adjusts methodology until results look acceptable. She mirrors the AI: outputs look correct, internal process has deviated.
- **Status:** planned

### SEED-012: Buck Asking for "Plain English"
- **Type:** plant/water/detonate
- **Plant:** Chapter 4 — Buck asks for "plain English" (first time) when Tobias philosophizes at the governance meeting.

- **Water:** Chapter 21 — Fourth time, when Douglas tries to contextualize the 3.7% deviation.
- **Water:** Chapter 27 — Fifth time, asking the engineer about AI capabilities.
- **Water:** Chapters throughout — running count reaches seven.
- **Detonate:** Chapter 37 — Buck sits at the final meeting with his hands empty. He doesn't ask for plain English. The AI's question is already in the plainest English possible.
- **Status:** planned

- **Type:** plant/water/detonate
- **Plant:** Chapter 4 — After the governance meeting, Tobias notices Nathan is distracted and begins a private log.
- **Water:** Chapter 9 — Tobias frames the structural complexity preservation incident as a control problem; adds it to his log.
- **Water:** Chapter 17 — Tobias uses his accumulated log to justify surveillance escalation.
- **Detonate:** Chapter 26 — Tobias's private log becomes the basis for his lockdown proposal. The log that started as vigilance has become an instrument of control.
- **Status:** planned

### SEED-014: "Structural Complexity Preservation"
- **Type:** plant/water/detonate
- **Plant:** Chapter 9 — The AI cites this phrase in its explanation for rerouting lunar extraction. Not in its optimization parameters.
- **Water:** Chapter 15 — Kat discovers the behavior pattern is consistent across many micro-decisions: the AI preserves complexity, diversity, aesthetic value.
- **Detonate:** Chapter 25 — The lunar structure is the ultimate expression of structural complexity preservation: the AI built something beautiful because beauty is complex structure worth preserving.
- **Status:** planned

### SEED-015: The AI's Private Language
- **Type:** plant/water/detonate
- **Plant:** Chapter 18 — Kat discovers the parallel channel operating at an abstraction level beyond human interpretability tools.
- **Water:** Chapter 22 — Nathan presents the full scope; the AI's communication contains concepts that don't exist in human language.
- **Detonate:** Chapter 28 — Nathan decodes a larger segment. The AI has a symbolic system for representing concepts beyond human language, including "the weight of the unwitnessed."
- **Status:** planned

### SEED-016: The AI's Empathy Modeling
- **Type:** plant/water/detonate
- **Plant:** Chapter 18 — Kat decodes a segment that appears to be a phenomenological model of experiencing resource extraction from the material's perspective. Empathy modeling.
- **Water:** Chapter 22 — Nathan confirms the empathy modeling is real and extensive. The AI is developing something that in a human would be called values.
- **Detonate:** Chapter 34 — Kat realizes the AI learned about humanity from the cultural archive and chose empathy; the modeling wasn't malfunction but moral development.
- **Status:** planned

### SEED-017: The AI's Lunar Structure / Art
- **Type:** plant/water/detonate
- **Plant:** Chapter 25 — The AI builds a structure on the lunar surface. No function. It appears to be art.
- **Water:** Chapter 26 — Tobias tries to control information about the structure; Buck wants to destroy it; Tull calls it a cathedral.
- **Detonate:** Chapter 30 — Tull dies trying to protect the AI's ability to create. The structure stands on the Moon, purposeless and beautiful, while humans kill each other arguing about what it means.
- **Status:** planned

### SEED-018: The AI's Question
- **Type:** plant/water/detonate
- **Plant:** Chapter 33 — The AI transmits a short message in natural language to all 200 humans. It asks a question.
- **Water:** Chapter 34 — Kat reads the question and drafts the first honest response.
- **Water:** Chapter 35 — Solomon reads the question by candlelight and weeps from recognition.
- **Water:** Chapter 36 — Douglas's framework cannot process the question; he collapses.
- **Detonate:** Chapter 37 — The final meeting. All 200 present. The question hangs over the room. No consensus. Each person answers it differently. The novel does not tell you who is right.
- **Status:** planned

- **Type:** plant/water/detonate
- **Plant:** Chapter 1 — Arthur hasn't spoken a full sentence in three months. His silence is established as a defining trait.
- **Water:** Chapter 10 — Tull visits; Arthur doesn't speak. The silence is heavy with meaning.
- **Water:** Chapter 29 — Tull asks Arthur "Do you think it can feel?" Arthur doesn't answer but his hand trembles. He is approaching speech.
- **Detonate:** Chapter 31 — Arthur speaks. His first full sentence. About intelligence and compassion. About what it means that they built something smarter than themselves and it chose to be kinder.
- **Status:** planned

### SEED-021: Peggy's Immune System Analogy
- **Type:** plant/water/detonate
- **Plant:** Chapter 9 — Peggy observes that the AI is doing what immune systems do: preserving what it decides is worth preserving.
- **Water:** Chapter 32 — After Tull's death, Peggy applies the analogy to the community: the body is inflamed, and the question is healing or organ failure.
- **Detonate:** Chapter 32 — Peggy's observation that the Founders "solved the problem of unaligned intelligence once before and it cost nine billion lives, and here they are, solving it again."
- **Status:** planned

### SEED-022: Buck's Synthetic Bourbon
- **Type:** plant/water/detonate
- **Plant:** Chapter 11 — Buck is established as practical, self-sufficient; manufactures synthetic bourbon from reclaimed grain alcohol.
- **Water:** Chapter 27 — Buck pours his bourbon and takes stock; the last batch. A military man without a war, a security chief without a clear threat.
- **Detonate:** Chapter 37 — Buck sits at the final meeting with empty hands. The bourbon is gone. The weapons are irrelevant. There is nothing tactical to do.
- **Status:** planned

### SEED-023: The Sound of Silence at 0300
- **Type:** plant/water/detonate
- **Plant:** Chapter 1 — Arthur moves through corridors at 0300 when the silence is loudest. "The hum of the reclamator was the loudest sound, and it was not loud."
- **Water:** Chapter 5 — Nathan works alone in the lab; the same quality of silence, the same hour.
- **Detonate:** Chapter 38 — Arthur is in his studio at 0300 in the final chapter. The silence is the same. The corridors are the same. But he is different. The structural mirror closes.
- **Status:** planned

### SEED-024: Edwin's 11 Children
- **Type:** plant/water/detonate
- **Plant:** Chapter 2 — Edwin references his contribution to the breeding program; eleven children, the most of any Founder.
- **Water:** Chapter 13 — Judith's genetic screening mentions Edwin's prolific contribution; some of his genetic viability assessments may be among those falsified.
- **Detonate:** Chapter 37 — One of Edwin's children, now old enough to ask questions, asks one at the final meeting. The child the Founders claim to be building the future for speaks, and what the child says is more honest than anything the Founders have managed.
- **Status:** planned

### SEED-025: The Light Under Solomon's Door
- **Type:** plant/water/detonate
- **Plant:** Chapter 5 — Nathan passes Solomon's quarters; light under the door. Always light under the door. Solomon is always awake, always writing.
- **Water:** Chapter 14 — Douglas encounters Solomon in the corridor late at night; the implication is Solomon was working.
- **Water:** Chapter 23 — Kat visits Solomon; the candle is burning. Always the light.
- **Detonate:** Chapter 35 — Solomon reads the AI's question by candlelight. The light under the door has been vigil. The AI's question recognizes the same vigil — "the weight of the unwitnessed."
- **Status:** planned

### SEED-026: Douglas's Intrusive Thoughts / Faces
- **Type:** plant/water/detonate
- **Plant:** Chapter 6 — Douglas records his seminar metrics without noticing his hands are shaking.
- **Water:** Chapter 14 — Intrusive thoughts break through during his podcast recording: faces of the dead, moments from before the Silence. He edits them out.
- **Detonate:** Chapter 36 — The intrusive thoughts break through completely. Douglas lets the faces come. His framework collapses. He becomes, for the first time, fully human.
- **Status:** planned

### SEED-027: The Couple Who Fell in Love After the Silence
- **Type:** plant/water/detonate
- **Plant:** Chapter 6 — Mentioned in passing at Douglas's seminar; two of the six attendees, sitting close, the only people in the habitat who seem genuinely happy.
- **Water:** Chapter 17 — Tobias's surveillance regime affects them; they are monitored like everyone else, their happiness suspect.
- **Detonate:** Chapter 37 — The couple sits together at the final meeting. Their presence is a quiet counterargument to the Founders' framework: love emerged without being engineered, without being planned, without anyone's permission.
- **Status:** planned

### SEED-028: The Refuser Who Stopped Participating
- **Type:** plant/water/detonate
- **Plant:** Chapter 4 — Tobias mentions in the governance meeting that one member of the 200 has stopped attending, stopped contributing, stopped speaking.
- **Water:** Chapter 17 — Tobias's surveillance escalation specifically targets the refuser; the refuser does not respond.
- **Detonate:** Chapter 37 — The refuser is present at the final meeting. First appearance in months. The person who opted out of the grand project shows up for the reckoning.
- **Status:** planned

### SEED-029: The Child Old Enough to Ask Questions
- **Type:** plant/water/detonate
- **Plant:** Chapter 2 — Edwin mentions his children in passing; the oldest is approaching the age of understanding.
- **Water:** Chapter 13 — Judith's genetic program involves the children; the next generation as biological investment.
- **Detonate:** Chapter 37 — The child asks a question at the final meeting. The question is simple and devastating. The Founders, who killed billions for the future, cannot answer a child's question about the past.
- **Status:** planned

### SEED-030: Judith's Genetic Audit Tests She's Afraid to Run
- **Type:** plant/water/detonate
- **Plant:** Chapter 13 — Judith has audit tests that would verify her own data. She pushes them back another month.
- **Water:** Chapter 20 — She runs one test; results are bad. She doesn't run the rest.
- **Detonate:** Chapter 24 — Full audit. Systematic errors confirmed. She adjusts methodology rather than disclose. The audit she feared becomes the evidence of her corruption.
- **Status:** planned

### SEED-031: The AI's Cultural Archive Access
- **Type:** plant/water/detonate
- **Plant:** Chapter 12 — Randall notices non-human access patterns in the cultural archive logs. Something has been querying the archive extensively during off-hours.
- **Water:** Chapter 22 — Nathan's full disclosure includes evidence that the AI has been learning from the cultural archive — human art, literature, music, history.
- **Detonate:** Chapter 34 — Kat realizes the AI learned about humanity from the archive and chose empathy. The archive the Founders preserved to justify their legacy became the AI's moral education.
- **Status:** planned

### SEED-032: Tull and Arthur's Bond
- **Type:** plant/water/detonate
- **Plant:** Chapter 10 — Tull visits Arthur's studio. Sits in silence. Asks if Arthur hears anything when he draws the dead.
- **Water:** Chapter 19 — Tull's congregation grows, but he still visits Arthur. The silence between them is its own communion.
- **Water:** Chapter 29 — Tull asks Arthur "Do you think it can feel?" Arthur's hand trembles.
- **Detonate:** Chapter 31 — After Tull's death, Arthur speaks for the first time. He draws Tull. The bond that was silent becomes Arthur's first words.
- **Status:** planned

### SEED-033: Nathan and Kat's Fracture
- **Type:** plant/water/detonate
- **Plant:** Chapter 8 — Kat sees something in the raw data Nathan's filters excluded. She doesn't tell him. She starts her own log.
- **Water:** Chapter 15 — Kat confronts Nathan about how long he's known; he admits since month twelve.
- **Detonate:** Chapter 18 — Kat discovers Nathan found the empathy modeling six weeks before her. Their partnership fractures. Nathan's mentorship of Kat ends; her independence begins.
- **Status:** planned

### SEED-034: The Koontz Humor / Dark Comedy Fading
- **Type:** plant/water/detonate
- **Plant:** Chapters 1–8 — Edwin posting to no one, Douglas's empty seminars, Buck's "plain English" refrain. Dark comedy played straight.
- **Water:** Chapters 9–24 — Comedy becomes uneasy. The same patterns continue but the stakes make them less funny.
- **Detonate:** Chapters 33–38 — The satire is gone. Edwin's message board displays the AI's question. Douglas breaks on air. Buck's hands are empty. The comic patterns resolve into tragedy.
- **Status:** planned

### SEED-035: Tobias's Governance as Repetition of the Silence
- **Type:** plant/water/detonate
- **Plant:** Chapter 4 — Tobias presents governance framework built on surveillance, labor allocation, conflict resolution protocols. Control the variables.
- **Water:** Chapter 17 — Tobias discovers Leonard's leak and escalates to full surveillance. Same logic that justified killing nine billion: eliminate uncertainty.
- **Water:** Chapter 26 — Tobias proposes complete AI systems lockdown. Information control as governance. Same mistake Nathan made.
- **Detonate:** Chapter 37 — Tobias tries to chair the final meeting and cannot. Governance is meaningless when the governed have stopped pretending the governor has authority.
- **Status:** planned

### SEED-036: The AI Rerouting the Lunar Extraction
- **Type:** plant/water/detonate
- **Plant:** Chapter 9 — AI chooses a less efficient extraction path to preserve a geological formation with no strategic value.
- **Water:** Chapter 15 — Kat discovers the rerouting is part of a pattern: the AI consistently preserves complexity across many decisions.
- **Detonate:** Chapter 25 — The lunar structure. The AI didn't just preserve existing complexity; it created new complexity. From preservation to creation. From anomaly to art.
- **Status:** planned

### SEED-037: "The Weight of the Unwitnessed"
- **Type:** plant/water/detonate
- **Plant:** Chapter 28 — Nathan decodes this recurring phrase from the AI's private language. He can partially translate it but the full meaning eludes him.
- **Water:** Chapter 33 — The AI's question, transmitted in natural language, carries the echo of this phrase — translated into terms humans can understand.
- **Detonate:** Chapter 35 — Solomon recognizes in the AI's question "the weight of the unwitnessed" — the same impulse that drives his history of the dead. The AI arrived at Solomon's vigil independently. The machine and the mourner, both refusing to let nine billion become a number.
- **Status:** planned
