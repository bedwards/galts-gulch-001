## Notes on Distribution

- **Arthur** bookends the novel (Ch 1 and Ch 38) and delivers the emotional climax (Ch 31). His chapters are deliberately sparse — he is a man approaching speech the way a man approaches a cliff.
- **Nathan** has the most chapters (5) because he is the information gatekeeper. The reader needs his perspective to understand what is and isn't being shared.
- **Kat** has 4 chapters, each marking a stage in her moral awakening: apprentice (8), investigator (15), accuser (18), respondent (34).
- **Solomon** appears three times, always quietly, always at night, always with fire. His chapters are the novel's resting heartbeat.
- **Tull** gets three chapters culminating in his death chapter (30). The reader must know him well enough to feel the loss.
- **Edwin** appears only twice — enough to establish and puncture his delusion without overstaying.
- **Peggy** gets one chapter (32) — strategically placed after Tull's death to provide clinical, distanced analysis when the reader needs it most.
- **Randall** gets one chapter (12) — the outsider perspective, the storyteller watching the story happen.
