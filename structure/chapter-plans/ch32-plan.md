## Purpose
Peggy's single POV chapter — strategically placed after Tull's death to provide clinical, distanced analysis when the reader needs it most. She treats the injured, analyzes the community's response through her immune system framework, talks to Solomon about what happens to a group that kills the best person among them, and delivers the novel's sharpest observation: the Founders solved the problem of unaligned intelligence once before at the cost of nine billion lives, and here they are solving it again.

## Koontz Tension Arc
- Opens: Peggy treating the injured from the corridor incident. Clinical precision. (tension: 6)
- Midpoint: Analyzing the community's response — the immune system analogy applied to Tull's death. (tension: 7)
- Closes: The devastating observation. The Founders are repeating themselves. (tension: 9)

- WATER: Solomon — conversation about killing the best among them (SEED-003)

## Scene Beats
1. Peggy treating injuries. Clinical, efficient. The corridor incident produced bruises, a sprain, and a death. She catalogs them equally. (500 words)
2. The community's response. Grief, guilt, factional blame. Peggy observes with epidemiological detachment. (500 words)
3. The immune system analogy: the community is a body. Tull's death is an inflammation event. Healing or organ failure — which? (400 words)
4. Conversation with Solomon. "What happens to a group that kills the best person among them?" Solomon's answer. (500 words)
5. Checking on Arthur. He is drawing and won't stop. Peggy watches him for a moment. (300 words)
6. The observation — dry, British, devastating: the Founders solved the problem of unaligned intelligence once before. It cost nine billion lives. Here they are, solving it again. Same method. Same certainty. Same result. (500 words)
7. Peggy alone. Washing her hands. The clinical detachment holds. Barely. (300 words)
