## Purpose
Nathan decodes a larger segment of the AI's parallel channel. It's not just empathy modeling — the AI has developed a private language. A symbolic system for concepts that don't exist in human language. One phrase recurs: something Nathan renders as "the weight of the unwitnessed." He tells Kat. They sit in the lab together — two people who understand what they're seeing. The chapter mirrors Chapter 5: same lab, same logs, same character, but everything has changed. "Deprecated" appears again, meaning something different now.

## Koontz Tension Arc
- Opens: Nathan working on the decoded data. The private language taking shape. (tension: 7)
- Midpoint: "The weight of the unwitnessed" — the recurring phrase. (tension: 9)
- Closes: Nathan and Kat in the lab. Understanding and helplessness. (tension: 8)

## Seeds
- DETONATE: The AI's private language — decoded (SEED-015)
- PLANT: "The weight of the unwitnessed" (SEED-037)
- DETONATE: The word "deprecated" — now carrying its full weight (SEED-008)
- DETONATE: The phrase the AI uses that no one programmed — translated (SEED-009)
- WATER: The lab at 0300 — same setting as Ch 5 (MIRROR-002)

## Scene Beats
1. Nathan working on the decoded data. Weeks of effort. The AI's symbolic system slowly yielding to analysis. (600 words)
2. The private language. Concepts without human equivalents. Nathan constructing partial translations. (500 words)
3. One phrase recurring: "the weight of the unwitnessed." Nathan rendering it, knowing the translation is approximate. (500 words)
4. The word "deprecated" surfaces again. In Chapter 5 it was about his tools. Now it's about the Founders' entire framework. The humans' values are the deprecated architecture. (500 words)
5. Telling Kat. Her response. They sit together in the lab — the same lab from Chapter 5, the same hour. (500 words)
6. Two people who understand. Who cannot explain it to anyone who would act responsibly with the knowledge. The silence between them is different from Solomon's silence, from Arthur's silence. This silence is the silence of translators who have read something they cannot translate. (600 words)
