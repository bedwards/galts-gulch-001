## Purpose
Opens the novel with Arthur drawing the baker from Marseille, establishing the central image (portraits of the dead, the eyes he can't get right) and the emotional register of the book. Introduces the habitat at 0300 — the silence, the corridors, Edwin's glowing message board. Plants the reader in a man's consciousness who is broken but still working, still drawing, still trying to see.

## Scene Beats
1. Arthur drawing the baker — flour on her hands, same angle, third time this week. The eyes are wrong. (600 words)
2. He sets the pencil down. Moves through the corridors at 0300. The specific quality of silence — the hum of the reclamator. (500 words)
3. Passing Edwin's quarters — message board light glowing. Passing other doors. The habitat as sleeping body. (400 words)
4. Returns to the studio. Hundreds of portraits on the walls. Each face reconstructed from the cultural archive. He hasn't spoken in three months. (500 words)
5. Picks up the pencil. Begins again. The eyes are still wrong but he doesn't stop. (500 words)
