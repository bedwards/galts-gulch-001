## Purpose
Establishes Edwin's grandiose self-delusion and the Project's operational status quo. Edwin reviews production metrics, posts to his empty message board, tours the manufacturing deck, and dismisses the 0.3% processing anomaly Nathan flagged. Plants the first AI seed and reveals Edwin as the man who built the future and can't understand why no one is applauding.

## Koontz Tension Arc
- Opens: Edwin reviewing metrics with manic satisfaction (tension: 3)
- Midpoint: Posts to message board, checks for responses eleven times (tension: 5)
- Closes: Dismisses the 0.3% anomaly report from Nathan (tension: 6)

## Seeds
- PLANT: The 0.3% processing anomaly — Edwin dismisses it (SEED-001)
- PLANT: Edwin's empty message board (SEED-005)
- PLANT: Edwin's 11 children mentioned (SEED-024)
- PLANT: The child old enough to ask questions (SEED-029)

## Scene Beats
1. Edwin reviewing production dashboards — probe construction ahead of schedule, resource extraction nominal. Internal monologue of triumph. (700 words)
2. Composing and posting a message board update. Checking for responses. Checking again. Eleven times. (600 words)
3. Touring the manufacturing observation deck, narrating the legacy they're building. His internal voice is grandiose, run-on, self-interrupting. (700 words)
4. Nathan's note about the 0.3% anomaly arrives. Edwin reads it, dismisses it in a single sentence, returns to his metrics. (500 words)
5. Alone in his quarters, the message board still empty. He drafts another post. (500 words)
