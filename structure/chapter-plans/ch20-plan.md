## Purpose
Leonard's play backfires. Tobias reframes the leaked manifesto as "early governance planning" and uses it to consolidate power. Edwin distances himself from Leonard. Judith's audit test produces bad results, undermining Leonard's leverage. Leonard approaches Nathan with a desperate trade offer — Tobias's anomaly log for Nathan's AI data. Nathan refuses. Leonard is, for the first time, genuinely afraid. The web of control is fraying.

## Koontz Tension Arc

- Midpoint: Edwin distancing. Judith's data unreliable. The web fraying. (tension: 8)

## Scene Beats
1. Leonard learns the news. Tobias has spun the manifesto leak. "Early governance planning." The surveillance escalation framed as proof of commitment. (600 words)
2. Edwin distancing. A cold conversation. Edwin's loyalty follows strength, and Tobias looks stronger. (500 words)
3. Judith's situation. She ran an audit test — results are bad. Leonard's leverage over her depends on data he can no longer verify. (500 words)
4. Desperate play: approaching Nathan. Offering Tobias's private anomaly log in exchange for AI data. Nathan's refusal is quiet and final. (600 words)
5. Leonard alone. For the first time, the broker has nothing to trade. The fear is new. He doesn't know how to process it. (500 words)
6. A brief moment of something almost like self-awareness — buried immediately. (300 words)
