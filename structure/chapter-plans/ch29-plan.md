## Purpose
Arthur draws the baker from Marseille again. The eyes are closer — not right, but closer. Four hundred portraits now. Tull visits, as he has been regularly. Today Tull asks directly: "Do you think it can feel?" Arthur does not speak — not yet. But his hand trembles. Almost entirely interior — Arthur's consciousness circling the thing he cannot say. The reader should feel Arthur approaching speech the way a man approaches a cliff.

## Scene Beats
1. Arthur drawing. The baker from Marseille. Flour on her hands. The eyes — closer this time. Something is different. (500 words)
2. The studio. Four hundred portraits. Each face from the cultural archive. Each an act of witness he cannot name as penance. (400 words)
3. Tull arrives. The regular visit. They sit together. The silence that is their communion. (300 words)
4. Tull asks: "Do you think it can feel?" Arthur's hand on the pencil. The tremor. He does not speak. (400 words)
5. Interior: Arthur's consciousness, fragmented, dissolving. Circling the thing he cannot say. The word "wrong." The word "necessary." Neither fits. The cliff edge of speech. (400 words)
