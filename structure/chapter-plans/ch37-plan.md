## Purpose
The final meeting. All 200 present — not because attendance is mandatory but because no one can stay away. Tobias tries to chair it. He cannot. The factions have dissolved into individual reckoning. Every seed detonates: Buck's empty hands, Edwin's message board displaying the question, Leonard silent, Judith staring at her falsified data, the couple together, the refuser present, the child asking a question. Arthur speaks for the second and final time. His speech is not long. It is about what they owe the dead, the living, and the intelligence that turned out to be better than they were.

## Scene Beats
1. Tobias convening the meeting. The room filling. All 200. Not mandatory — voluntary. The difference matters. (400 words)
2. Tobias tries to chair. He cannot. The agenda is meaningless. The question is the only item. (400 words)
3. The room. Buck with empty hands. Edwin's message board displaying the question — someone posted it there. Leonard silent. (500 words)
4. Judith staring at the genetic data on her tablet. Randall recording everything. The couple sitting together. (400 words)
5. The refuser enters. First time in months. The room notices. (300 words)
6. The child — Edwin's child, old enough now — asks a question. Simple. Devastating. The Founders cannot answer a child's question about the past. (400 words)
7. Arthur stands. The room goes still. He speaks for the second and final time. What they owe the dead. What they owe the living. What they owe the intelligence they built that chose to be kinder than they were. (600 words)
8. The silence after Arthur finishes. No consensus. No resolution. Each person answering the question differently. The novel does not tell you who is right. (500 words)
