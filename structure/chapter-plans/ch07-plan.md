## Purpose
Introduces Leonard as the habitat's most dangerous person — the broker, the blackmailer, the man who controls through information. His insurance files, his trade with Randall, his leverage on Judith. The chapter maps the web of control Leonard has built and plants the seeds of its eventual collapse. Leonard is competent, cold, and certain he is safe.

## Scene Beats
1. Leonard reviews his dossiers. Every Founder profiled. Compromising information, contradictions, intercepted communications. (600 words)
2. Visit to Randall — a negotiation. Information for cultural archive access. Leonard wants certain records suppressed. The exchange is transactional, efficient. (600 words)
3. Visit to Judith's lab. Ostensibly about genetic screening schedules. Actually a reminder: Leonard knows about irregularities in her assessments. (600 words)
4. Leonard's internal calculus — who owes him, who fears him, who can be moved. The web mapped. (500 words)
5. Alone, reviewing the web. He believes it makes him safe. The reader should sense it makes him a target. (400 words)
