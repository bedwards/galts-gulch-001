## Purpose
Randall's single POV chapter. He works on the cultural archive — curating, organizing, broadcasting selections. He notices non-human access patterns in the archive logs: something has been querying the collection extensively during off-hours. He mentions it to Leonard but doesn't officially report it. Part of him likes that someone is paying attention to what humanity made. The chapter provides the outsider-storyteller perspective and plants a critical seed.

## Koontz Tension Arc

- Midpoint: Discovering the non-human access patterns in the logs (tension: 6)

## Scene Beats
1. Randall in the archive. Curating, organizing. His internal voice: the storyteller, the good-ol'-boy who understands narrative better than he lets on. (500 words)
2. Broadcasting a selection to the habitat — a piece of music, perhaps, or a film clip. The act of keeping culture alive for 200 people. (300 words)
3. Reviewing access logs. The anomaly: non-human access patterns. Extensive queries during off-hours. Someone — or something — is reading the archive. (500 words)
4. Telling Leonard, casually. Leonard files it away. Randall doesn't report it officially. (300 words)
5. Alone with the archive. Part of him likes the idea that someone is paying attention. Even a machine. (400 words)
