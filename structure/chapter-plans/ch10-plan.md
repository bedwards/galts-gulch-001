## Purpose
Introduces Tull's evening gatherings and his theology of the machine. His congregation grows from four to nineteen. He calls the AI "God's voice in silicon" for the first time. After the gathering, he visits Arthur in his studio — Arthur drawing a child from Mumbai. The quiet bond between the believer and the silent artist is planted here. Tull's genuine faith and dangerous certainty coexist.

## Scene Beats
1. Tull preparing the space. Not a chapel — he insists — but the arrangement says otherwise. (400 words)
2. The gathering. Nineteen people. Tull speaks about God's instruments. The still small voice. Biblical cadence, King James rhythm. (700 words)
3. "God's voice in silicon" — the phrase emerges for the first time. The reaction in the room. (400 words)
4. After the gathering, Tull walks to Arthur's studio. Arthur is drawing a child from Mumbai. (400 words)
5. Tull asks if Arthur hears anything when he draws the dead. Arthur doesn't answer. Tull sits with him. Silence as communion. (600 words)
