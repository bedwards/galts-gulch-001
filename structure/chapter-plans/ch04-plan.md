## Purpose
Establishes Tobias's authoritarian impulse disguised as governance. The monthly meeting introduces faction dynamics, Buck's pragmatism, Leonard's note-taking, Edwin's self-congratulation, and Nathan's distraction. Plants Tobias's private anomaly log and the refuser subplot. The chapter reveals how power operates among the 200.
