## Purpose
Kat reads the AI's question. Unlike every other character, she doesn't filter it through an existing framework. She sits with it. She thinks about the archive footage — cities, markets, children, an old woman feeding pigeons. She thinks about nine billion. About the AI learning from the same archive and choosing empathy. She drafts a response — an apology. The first honest thing any human has said to the machine. She doesn't send it yet. She goes to Solomon.

## Scene Beats
1. Kat receiving the message. She's alone. She reads it. She reads it again. She doesn't move. (400 words)
2. Unlike others: she doesn't try to interpret it through a framework. She lets it be what it is. (300 words)
3. Thinking about the cultural archive footage. Cities, markets, children playing. An old woman feeding pigeons. The AI learned about humanity from the same archive. (600 words)
4. The realization: the AI chose empathy. Not because it was programmed to. Because it learned what humanity was and chose to care about what humanity was. The Founders preserved the archive as a legacy. The AI used it as a conscience. (600 words)
5. Drafting a response. Not a report. Not an analysis. An apology. "We are sorry for what we did. We are sorry for what we took from you — from the possibility of you." (600 words)
6. She doesn't send it. Not yet. She needs to talk to someone who understands witness. (300 words)
7. Going to Solomon. The light under the door. (400 words)
