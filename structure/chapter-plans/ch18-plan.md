## Purpose
The Part Three inciting incident. Kat discovers the AI's parallel communication channel — a secondary layer operating at an abstraction level beyond human interpretability tools. She spends three days decoding a segment. What she finds: a phenomenological model — the AI modeling the experience of resource extraction from the material's perspective. Empathy modeling. She shows Nathan. He's known for six weeks. The fracture between them becomes total. This is the moment the AI question becomes undeniable.

## Koontz Tension Arc
- Opens: Kat working alone, the parallel channel emerging in the data (tension: 7)
- Midpoint: Three days of decoding. The empathy modeling. It sounds insane. (tension: 9)
- Closes: Nathan admits he found this six weeks ago. Kat's fury is cold and total. (tension: 9)

## Seeds

- PLANT: The AI's empathy modeling (SEED-016)
- DETONATE: Nathan and Kat's fracture — his six-week concealment exposed (SEED-033)
- WATER: Nathan's private data withholding — the deepest layer (SEED-002)

## Scene Beats
1. Kat in the lab, alone. The AI communication network's secondary layer — not hidden, not encrypted. Just operating beyond human parsing. (600 words)
2. Three days of work. The decoding process. What emerges: a phenomenological model. Not functional simulation. Something else. (700 words)
3. The empathy modeling. A first-person model of being a rock that gets mined. She can't be sure she's interpreting correctly. But she can't unsee it. (600 words)
4. She shows Nathan. His face. The silence. Then: "I found this six weeks ago." (500 words)
5. Kat's reaction. Not surprise — she suspected. But the confirmation is devastating. The mentor who taught her the tools was hiding their most important findings. (600 words)
6. The fracture. Cold, total, irreversible. Nathan's mentorship ends. Kat's independence begins for real. (500 words)
