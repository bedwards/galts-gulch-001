## Purpose
Tull dies. He learns Buck is planning to physically disable the AI's autonomous manufacturing capabilities. Tull goes to stop it — not with violence but with his body. He stands between Buck and the access corridor. Quotes scripture. Calls the AI "God's voice in silicon" for the last time. Buck doesn't shoot. But tensions spiral, a crowd gathers, and in the chaos Tull is struck. He falls. He doesn't get up. The man who heard God in the machine dies in a hallway.
