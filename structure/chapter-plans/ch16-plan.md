## Purpose
Leonard moves against Tobias — leaking portions of Tobias's private manifesto to Edwin, approaching Buck with implications about Tobias's monitoring systems. Leonard plays five games simultaneously. He is the most competent person in the habitat and the most dangerous. The chapter ends with Leonard confident he's moved everyone into position. The reader should suspect he's miscalculated. This is the peak of Leonard's power.

## Scene Beats
1. Leonard reviewing the situation. Tobias consolidating power. Edwin pliable. Nathan distracted by AI data. An opening. (500 words)
2. The leak to Edwin. Portions of Tobias's manifesto — "early governance planning" that reads like authoritarian playbook. Edwin is alarmed. (600 words)
3. Approaching Buck. The implication: Tobias's monitoring systems could target humans as easily as AI. Buck's jaw tightens. (500 words)
4. Leonard's internal calculus. Five simultaneous games. Each person moved a step. Each move appears natural. (600 words)
5. Alone. Reviewing the web. Everything positioned. He's confident. The chapter ends on his certainty — which the reader should recognize as the certainty that precedes a fall. (500 words)
