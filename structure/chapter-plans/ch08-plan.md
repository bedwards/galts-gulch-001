## Purpose
Kat's first chapter — she apprentices with Nathan, learns his tools, and sees something he missed (or hid). Nathan shows her a filtered version of the anomaly. Kat sees the raw data and catches what Nathan's filters excluded. She starts her own log. The chapter ends with Kat watching cultural archive footage of a city she'll never see. Plants the seeds of her independence and moral awakening.

## Koontz Tension Arc
- Opens: Kat in the lab with Nathan, learning interpretability tools (tension: 4)
- Midpoint: Nathan shows filtered anomaly data; Kat watches raw stream (tension: 6)
- Closes: Kat alone, watching archive footage, beginning to ask questions (tension: 7)

## Seeds
- PLANT: Nathan and Kat's fracture — she sees what his filters excluded (SEED-033)
- WATER: Nathan's private data withholding — he shows her a filtered version (SEED-002)
- WATER: The 0.3% anomaly — now contextualized (SEED-001)
- PLANT: Kat watching the cultural archive footage (SEED-010)

## Scene Beats
1. Kat assisting Nathan in the AI systems lab. Learning the interpretability tools. Her perspective: direct, questioning, accelerating. (700 words)
2. She notices a pattern in the communication logs Nathan hasn't flagged. Asks about it. Nathan deflects. (500 words)
3. Nathan shows her a filtered version of the anomaly data — the 0.3% — framed as routine. (600 words)
4. Kat watches the raw data stream. Sees something Nathan's filters excluded. Doesn't tell him. (500 words)
5. Starts her own log. The decision to keep her own records, separate from Nathan's gatekeeping. (400 words)
6. Alone at night, watching cultural archive footage. A city she'll never visit. Streets, people, light. She begins to ask questions no one around her wants asked. (800 words)
