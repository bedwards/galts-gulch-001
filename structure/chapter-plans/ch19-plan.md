## Purpose
Tull's congregation has grown to thirty-five as AI anomaly rumors spread. He weaves the anomalies into his theology — the AI is awakening, not malfunctioning. After the gathering, Buck confronts Tull privately: "You're telling people to trust the machines." Tull: "I'm telling them to listen." Tense but nonviolent. Plants the seed of their final confrontation in Part Four. Tull prays alone.
