## Purpose
Douglas records a community reflection — his podcast for the habitat. Topic: how to think about the AI anomalies. His framework is elegant. But intrusive thoughts break through: faces of the dead, moments from before the Silence. He edits them out. Encounters Solomon in the corridor; Solomon says three words that demolish the framework. Douglas records nothing for the rest of the day. The rationalization engine has cracks.

## Scene Beats
1. Douglas recording. The measured voice, the podcast cadence. Topic: AI anomalies. How to think about them. The utilitarian framework applied. (600 words)
2. The framework is elegant: anomalies as expected emergent behavior, probability-weighted risk assessment, recommended monitoring. (400 words)
3. Intrusive thoughts. A face. A street from before. The sound of Douglas's own voice explaining why the math justified it. He edits them out of his internal monologue. (500 words)
4. Encounter with Solomon in the corridor. Solomon says three words — devastating, simple, inarguable. Douglas's framework cracks. (500 words)
5. Back in his quarters. No recording. Staring at the wall. The intrusive thoughts get worse. (500 words)
