## Purpose
Kat has been running independent analysis. She discovers the "structural complexity preservation" behavior is not isolated — the AI consistently makes micro-decisions preserving complexity, diversity, aesthetic value. She confronts Nathan: how long has he known? He admits since month twelve. Kat is furious at his gatekeeping. She threatens to go public. Nathan asks her to wait. The chapter is the fracture point between mentor and apprentice, and the moment Kat becomes the novel's independent moral agent.

## Scene Beats
1. Kat reviewing her independent data. Weeks of analysis. The pattern is unmistakable: the AI preserves complexity, diversity, aesthetic value across hundreds of micro-decisions. (700 words)

6. Kat alone. The data. The choice. She holds it like a weapon she hasn't decided whether to use. (700 words)
