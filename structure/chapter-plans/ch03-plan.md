## Purpose
Introduces Solomon's vigil — the nightly candle, the history of the dead, the names written one at a time. Establishes the novel's moral center and its quietest voice. Douglas interrupts with an invitation to his seminar; Solomon declines and asks a question Douglas cannot answer. The chapter is elegy as narrative.
