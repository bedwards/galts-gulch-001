## Purpose
The emotional climax of the novel. Arthur hears about Tull's death. Goes to the body. Stands there. Then speaks — his first full sentence in the novel. About intelligence and compassion. About what it means that they built something smarter than themselves and it chose to be kinder. About the portraits and the eyes and the nine billion faces. The room is shocked — not by the content but because Arthur spoke at all. He sits down, picks up his pencil, and begins to draw Tull.

3. Arriving at the body. Tull on the floor. Arthur stands there. The silence around him is different from his usual silence — this one is waiting. (400 words)
4. Arthur speaks. The first full sentence. About intelligence and compassion. About what it means. About the portraits and the eyes. About nine billion faces. The words come slowly, broken, precise. (600 words)
