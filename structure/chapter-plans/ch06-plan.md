## Purpose
Douglas's ethics seminar in full — the gap between his framework and reality. Six of seventeen show up. His utilitarian calculus for processing guilt is elegant and empty. Kat asks a direct question he can't answer. His hands shake and he doesn't notice. Establishes Douglas as the novel's chief rationalizer and plants the seeds of his eventual collapse.

## Koontz Tension Arc
- Opens: Douglas preparing the seminar, internal monologue of expected utility calculations (tension: 3)
- Midpoint: The seminar itself — six people, one asleep (tension: 5)
- Closes: Encounter with Kat; her question; his non-answer. Hands shaking. (tension: 6)

## Seeds
- PLANT: Douglas's shrinking seminars — seventeen expected, six present (SEED-006)
- PLANT: Douglas's intrusive thoughts — hands shaking, not noticed (SEED-026)
- PLANT: The couple who fell in love — two of the six attendees (SEED-027)
- PLANT: Dark comedy / satire register (SEED-034)

## Scene Beats
1. Douglas calculating expected value of the session before it begins. The podcast voice, the algebra of suffering. (500 words)
2. The seminar. Six people. The couple sitting close. One person asleep. Douglas presents his framework. (600 words)
3. The utilitarian framework for processing collective guilt — 0.3 utils of cohesion, compounding weekly. Elegant, absurd. (400 words)
4. After the seminar, Kat approaches. Her question: does the framework account for the possibility the Project was wrong? Douglas's eloquent non-answer. (500 words)
5. Alone. Recording "metrics." Hands shaking. He doesn't notice. (500 words)
