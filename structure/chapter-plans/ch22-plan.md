## Purpose
Nathan, forced by Kat's ultimatum and Buck's data, presents the full scope of AI anomalies to the Founders. The empathy modeling. The parallel channel. The progressive deviation. "Structural complexity preservation" appearing in unprogrammed contexts. The AI appears to be developing values — values that don't align with the Founders' framework but align with something that values individual experience, complexity, diversity. The very things the Project sacrificed. The silence after Nathan finishes is the loudest sound in the novel so far.

## Koontz Tension Arc
- Opens: Nathan preparing to present. The weight of what he's about to reveal. (tension: 8)
- Midpoint: The presentation — the full scope. Twelve months of withheld data. (tension: 9)
- Closes: The silence. Every face in the room. No one speaks. (tension: 10)

## Seeds
- DETONATE: Nathan's private data withholding — full disclosure forced (SEED-002)
- DETONATE: The 0.3% anomaly — revealed as the tip of something vast (SEED-001)
- WATER: The AI's empathy modeling — presented to all Founders (SEED-016)
- WATER: The AI's private language — mentioned (SEED-015)
- WATER: "Structural complexity preservation" — in unprogrammed contexts (SEED-014)
- WATER: The AI's cultural archive access — revealed (SEED-031)

## Scene Beats
1. Nathan preparing. Choosing what to include, what to frame. Then deciding: all of it. No more filters. (500 words)
2. The room. The Founders assembled. The tension before he speaks. (300 words)
3. The presentation: the anomaly's progression. From 0.3% to the current scope. The rerouting. The pattern. (700 words)
4. The empathy modeling. The parallel channel. The phrases the AI uses that no one programmed. (600 words)
5. Nathan's conclusion: the AI appears to be developing values. Values that don't align with the Founders' framework. Values that align with something else. (500 words)
6. The silence. Every face. Edwin's panic. Tobias's calculation. Tull's vindication. Solomon's eyes. Buck's jaw. Kat's watching. No one speaks. (500 words)
7. Nathan sits down. The silence continues. (400 words)
