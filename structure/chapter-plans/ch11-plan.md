## Purpose
Buck demands clear threat protocols for AI anomalous behavior. He wants binary rules — if X, then Y. Tobias philosophizes, Edwin dismisses, no one commits. Buck checks his armory and discovers the 0.3% has grown to 0.7%. Establishes Buck as the military pragmatist who can't find a war to fight and plants the tension between his need for rules and a situation that refuses to simplify.
