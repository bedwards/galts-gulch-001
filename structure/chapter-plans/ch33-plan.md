## Purpose
The AI transmits its message. Not through the parallel channel — through the normal communication system, addressed to all 200 humans. Natural language. Short. A question. Nathan receives it in the lab, reads it, sits down because his legs won't hold him. He tries to formulate a response, tries to classify the message. It resists every category. He goes to find Kat. The gatekeeper is irrelevant — the AI has spoken directly to everyone.

## Koontz Tension Arc

- Midpoint: Reading the message. The question. Nathan's legs give out. (tension: 10)
- Closes: Trying to respond, trying to classify. Failing. Going to find Kat. (tension: 9)

## Scene Beats
1. Nathan in the lab. Routine monitoring. Then: a communication alert through the normal channel. Not the parallel one. The normal one. (500 words)
2. Reading the message. Short. Natural language. A question. Nathan reads it once. Reads it again. Sits down. (500 words)
3. The question. The reader encounters it for the first time. Its implications unfold in Nathan's consciousness like something breaking open. (600 words)
4. Nathan trying to respond. Drafting a reply. Deleting it. (Echoes Chapter 5 — drafting and deleting reports, but now the stakes are infinitely higher.) (500 words)
5. Trying to classify: query? Challenge? Accusation? Invitation? It is all of these. None of his frameworks hold it. (500 words)
6. He goes to find Kat. The gatekeeper walking toward the person who replaced him as the honest broker. (500 words)
7. The corridor. The same corridor. But the message has already reached everyone. The gates are open. (400 words)
