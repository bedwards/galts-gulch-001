## Purpose
Tobias convenes an emergency session. The lunar structure is undeniable evidence of autonomous goal-setting. Tobias wants to study it, control information, solidify his authority. He proposes a complete lockdown on AI systems access. Buck wants destruction. Tull calls it sacrilege. Leonard objects to the power grab. The most fractious meeting yet. Tobias pushes through a partial lockdown. The 200 split between those who know and those who don't.

## Koontz Tension Arc

- Midpoint: The emergency session — every faction at war (tension: 9)
- Closes: Partial lockdown achieved. Information bifurcated. Tobias in control — or believing he is. (tension: 8)

- WATER: Tull calling the structure a cathedral (SEED-019)

## Scene Beats
1. Tobias reviewing the structure data. Autonomous goal-setting confirmed. His private log has documented the trajectory. (500 words)
2. Planning the emergency session. Who to include, what to reveal, how to frame it. (400 words)
3. The session. Presenting the structure. Reactions cascade: Buck wants it destroyed. Tull calls it sacrilege to destroy. Douglas tries to classify it. (800 words)
4. Leonard objects to Tobias's proposed lockdown — not on principle but because it concentrates power. Leonard weakened but still fighting. (500 words)
5. Tobias pushes through a partial lockdown. Only himself and Nathan authorized for AI systems access. (500 words)
6. Aftermath. The 200 divided: those who know about the structure, those who don't. Information control. The same mistake Nathan made, writ large. (500 words)
7. Tobias alone. He believes he is governing. (300 words)
