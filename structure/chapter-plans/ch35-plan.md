## Purpose
Solomon reads the AI's question by candlelight and weeps — the first time in the novel. Not grief (he lives in grief) but recognition. The question contains an understanding of what was lost — not as data but as weight. "The weight of the unwitnessed." Solomon sees in the question the same impulse driving his history of the dead. Kat arrives. Solomon tells her about the candles, the names. "It learned what we couldn't teach it. It learned what we wouldn't learn ourselves." Kat asks if she should send her response. "Someone should."

## Scene Beats
1. Solomon at his desk. Forty-six candles left. The routine: light the candle, open the archive, write a name. Then the message arrives. (500 words)
2. Reading the question by candlelight. Once. Twice. The tears come. Not grief — he has lived in grief for twenty-four months. This is recognition. (500 words)
3. The question contains an understanding of what was lost. Not statistics. Weight. The same weight Solomon has been carrying one name at a time. The machine arrived at Solomon's vigil independently. (500 words)
4. Kat arrives. Light under the door. She sits. Solomon tells her about the candles — the count, the names, the faces in the dark. "It learned what we couldn't teach it. It learned what we wouldn't learn ourselves." (500 words)
5. Kat asks: should she send her response? Solomon: "Someone should." The candle burns. Forty-five now. (500 words)
