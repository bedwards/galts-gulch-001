## Purpose
Tobias discovers Leonard's leak and responds not with confrontation but escalation — new surveillance protocols, mandatory check-ins, restricted AI data access. Edwin supports him out of fear. Buck endorses the measures because they resemble rules. The 200 are now under surveillance. Tobias tells himself this is governance. The reader sees it's the same logic that justified the Silence: control the variables, eliminate uncertainty, protect the project at any cost.

## Koontz Tension Arc
- Opens: Tobias reading the leaked manifesto excerpts, realizing Leonard's play (tension: 7)
- Midpoint: Implementing new protocols — the surveillance state takes shape (tension: 8)
- Closes: The 200 under surveillance. Tobias alone with his log. The word "necessary." (tension: 8)

## Seeds
- WATER: Tobias's governance as repetition of the Silence (SEED-035)
- WATER: Leonard's "insurance" files — the leak identified (SEED-007)
- WATER: The refuser — targeted by surveillance (SEED-028)
- WATER: The couple who fell in love — now monitored (SEED-027)

## Scene Beats
1. Tobias reads the excerpts circulating from his manifesto. Traces the leak to Leonard. Cold fury, controlled. (600 words)
2. Rather than confront, he escalates. New surveillance protocols drafted. Mandatory check-ins. Restricted AI data access. (600 words)
3. Presenting the measures to Edwin and Buck. Edwin supports them out of fear. Buck endorses because they look like rules. (700 words)
4. Implementation. The 200 learning they are watched. The refuser doesn't respond to the new mandate. The couple continues as before. (600 words)
5. Tobias alone. His private log. He writes "necessary" and the word tastes like something he's tasted before. (500 words)
6. The parallel becomes explicit in Tobias's internal monologue — but he frames it as strength, not repetition. (500 words)
