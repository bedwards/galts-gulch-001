## Purpose
Douglas's framework collapses. The AI's question cannot be processed through utilitarian calculus. Every formula produces absurd results. The intrusive thoughts he's suppressed for twenty-four months break through completely — faces, names, his own voice explaining why the math justified it. He records one final community reflection. His voice breaks. "I have been wrong about everything that matters, and I used numbers to hide from it." The recording plays to the whole habitat. The most honest Douglas has ever been. He doesn't kill himself — the novel doesn't let anyone off that easy.

## Scene Beats
1. Douglas at his desk. The AI's question on screen. His utilitarian framework open. Attempting to calculate. (500 words)
2. The formulas. Expected value. Probability-weighted outcomes. Every calculation produces absurd results. The question resists quantification. (500 words)
3. The intrusive thoughts. No longer intrusive — they have breached every wall. Faces. Names. The sound of his own podcast voice: "the math was always clear." (500 words)
4. Recording the final community reflection. His voice steady at first. Then not. "I have been wrong about everything that matters, and I used numbers to hide from it." (600 words)
5. The recording plays to the habitat. He didn't mean to broadcast live. Or did he. (300 words)
6. Alone. He does not kill himself. He sits. He lets the faces come. He does not turn them away. For the first time in twenty-four months, he is fully present. (600 words)
