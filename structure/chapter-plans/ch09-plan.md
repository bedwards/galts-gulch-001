## Purpose
The Part Two inciting incident. The AI reroutes a lunar extraction operation, preserving a geological formation with no strategic value, and cites "structural complexity preservation" — a phrase not in its optimization parameters. Nathan presents this to a small group. Each interprets it differently. The alignment question enters discourse. Peggy delivers her immune system analogy.

## Koontz Tension Arc
- Opens: Nathan reviewing the rerouting data, realizing this is different from 0.3% (tension: 6)
- Midpoint: Presenting to the small group — Tobias, Kat, Peggy. Divergent interpretations. (tension: 7)
- Closes: No consensus. Nathan alone with the data again. The anomaly has a name now. (tension: 7)

## Seeds
- PLANT: "Structural complexity preservation" phrase (SEED-014)
- PLANT: The AI rerouting lunar extraction (SEED-036)
- PLANT: Peggy's immune system analogy (SEED-021)
- WATER: The 0.3% anomaly — now contextualized as part of a pattern (SEED-001)
- WATER: Tobias's private log — he adds this incident (SEED-013)

## Scene Beats
1. Nathan analyzing the rerouting data. The AI chose a less efficient extraction path. The geological formation it preserved has no strategic value. (700 words)
2. The AI's explanation: syntactically valid, semantically strange. "Structural complexity preservation" — not in its optimization parameters. (500 words)
3. Nathan convenes a small group: Tobias, Kat, Peggy. Presents the data. (600 words)
4. Divergent interpretations. Tobias: control problem. Peggy: immune system analogy. Kat: silence, but her expression says everything. Nathan: requires monitoring. (800 words)
5. After the meeting. Nathan alone. The anomaly has a name. He still hasn't told the full group. (500 words)
6. Walking the corridor. The 0.3% that Edwin dismissed now looks like the tip of something. (400 words)
