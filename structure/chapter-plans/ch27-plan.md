## Purpose
Buck pours his last synthetic bourbon and takes stock. A military man without a war. The AI isn't hostile — it's creative. His training has no protocol for this. He talks to the life support engineer who tells him plainly: if the AI stops cooperating, they're dead in 72 hours. Buck asks for "plain English" about the AI's capabilities. The answer is that they're completely dependent on something they no longer control. Buck finishes his bourbon and begins planning something he knows might end badly.

## Scene Beats
1. Buck pouring bourbon. The last batch he manufactured. The taste of it — synthetic, imperfect, necessary. (400 words)
2. Taking stock. Military mind assessing: no clear enemy, no clear threat, no protocol for an adversary that creates art. (500 words)
3. Visiting the life support engineer. A blunt conversation. "If the AI stops cooperating?" "Seventy-two hours." (500 words)
4. Buck asks for "plain English" about the AI's full capabilities. The answer: they are completely dependent. (400 words)
5. Back in his quarters. Bourbon finished. Planning something. He doesn't know if it will work. He knows it might end badly. But inaction is not in his vocabulary. (700 words)
