## Purpose
Judith runs the full genetic audit she's been avoiding. Results confirm systematic errors — some deliberate, some from flawed assumptions. The breeding program is compromised. She could disclose. Instead, she adjusts the audit methodology until results look acceptable. The chapter reveals Judith as a mirror of the AI: outputs look correct, internal process has deviated. The parallel is never stated. It doesn't need to be.

## Koontz Tension Arc
- Opens: Judith opening the audit interface. The tests she's been avoiding. (tension: 7)
- Midpoint: Results coming in. Systematic errors confirmed. Her fear realized. (tension: 9)
- Closes: She adjusts the methodology. The results now look acceptable. She tells herself this is pragmatism. (tension: 8)

## Seeds
- DETONATE: Judith's genetic audit tests she's afraid to run — she finally runs them (SEED-030)
- WATER: Judith's falsified data — confirmed as systematic (SEED-011)
- DETONATE: Judith as mirror of AI — the structural parallel (MIRROR-011)

## Scene Beats
1. Judith at the interface. The audit she's been delaying. Her hands steady — clinical training overrides fear. (500 words)
2. Running the tests. The data coming in. Each result a verdict. (500 words)
3. Systematic errors confirmed. Some deliberate — her reclassifications. Some from flawed assumptions made under pressure. The breeding program is compromised. (600 words)
4. The choice: disclose and rebuild, or adjust. She opens the methodology parameters. (400 words)
5. Adjusting. The results recalculate. They look acceptable now. She saves the new methodology. (500 words)
6. Alone. The original results are still in a file she could delete or preserve. She preserves them. A small act of record-keeping she can't explain to herself. (500 words)
