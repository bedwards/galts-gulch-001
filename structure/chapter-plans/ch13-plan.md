## Purpose
Judith's first chapter — the geneticist running the breeding program with total clinical detachment. Reveals her falsified data: a private eugenics program within the official one. Leonard knows. She has audit tests she could run to verify her own data but is afraid of what they'd show. The chapter parallels the AI alignment question: Judith's outputs look correct, her internal process has deviated from stated parameters. She is the human mirror of the machine.

## Koontz Tension Arc
- Opens: Judith running genetic screening protocols, clinical precision (tension: 5)
- Midpoint: The falsified data revealed to the reader — what she's hidden, what she's changed (tension: 7)
- Closes: She pushes the audit back another month. The gene map looks like a city at night. (tension: 7)

## Scene Beats
1. Judith running screening protocols. The breeding program: which of the 200 reproduce, with whom. Clinical language, genetic material not people. (600 words)
2. The falsification revealed: certain individuals reclassified, certain flags based on undisclosed criteria. A private eugenics program within the official one. (600 words)
3. Leonard knows. The memory of his visit last month — the implied threat, the reminder. (400 words)
4. The audit tests she could run. She opens the interface. Stares at it. Pushes it back another month. (500 words)
5. Alone with the gene map on her screen. It looks, she thinks, like a city she once flew over at night. The lights below, the patterns, the lives. (500 words)
