## Purpose
The quiet center of the storm. Solomon continues his vigil — tonight a schoolteacher from Oslo. He has heard the factions shouting. He lights his candle (147 left). Kat visits — the first time anyone has sought Solomon for conversation. She asks about the AI. Solomon answers with a parable about a man who built a house and was surprised when someone moved in. Kat leaves with more questions. Solomon writes another name.
