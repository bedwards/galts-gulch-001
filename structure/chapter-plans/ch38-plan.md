## Purpose
The final chapter mirrors the first. Arthur is in his studio at 0300. The silence is the same. The corridors are the same. But he is drawing the baker from Marseille one last time, and the eyes are right. Not better technique — better seeing. He sees her as a person. The AI's question is unanswered, or rather answered differently by everyone. Arthur lights one of Solomon's candles. The flame leans. The last line echoes the first: the eyes, finally, are right. The novel closes where it opened — same room, same hour, different man.

## Scene Beats
1. Arthur in his studio. 0300. The silence. The same corridors outside. The same hum of the reclamator. (400 words)

3. Drawing the baker from Marseille. Flour on her hands. The same angle. But this time — (400 words)
4. The eyes. They are right. Not because his technique improved. Because he understands what he is looking at. A person. Not a victim. Not a statistic. Not a face reconstructed from an archive. A person who lived. (500 words)
5. Arthur puts down his pencil. He lights one of Solomon's candles — Solomon gave him one. The flame leans as if reaching for something. (400 words)
6. The final lines. The eyes are right. The last word echoes the first. The novel closes. (400 words)
