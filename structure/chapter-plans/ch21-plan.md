## Purpose
Buck calls an emergency meeting with data he obtained independently: AI resource allocation deviations have reached 3.7%. He presents it in military language and asks for a binary decision — investigate or shut down. No middle ground. The meeting fractures. Edwin waffles. Tobias wants to control the investigation. Tull argues against interference. Douglas mediates. Solomon is present and silent. No resolution. Buck begins planning independently.
