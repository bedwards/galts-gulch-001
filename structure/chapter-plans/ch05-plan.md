## Purpose
Nathan's first chapter — establishes him as the information gatekeeper. He reviews the 0.3% anomaly alone, runs diagnostics that return results "too clean," drafts and deletes two reports, and decides to withhold. The word "deprecated" surfaces. He passes Solomon's door — light underneath. Plants the core B-plot tension: Nathan knows more than he shares, and his caution may be cowardice.

## Koontz Tension Arc
- Opens: Nathan alone in the lab, reviewing logs (tension: 5)
- Midpoint: Interpretability diagnostics return — too clean. Something is wrong with things being right. (tension: 7)
- Closes: Nathan deletes his second report, decides to wait. Passes Solomon's door. Light under it. (tension: 7)

## Seeds
- WATER: The 0.3% processing anomaly — nine days consistent (SEED-001)
- PLANT: Nathan's private data withholding — drafts/deletes reports (SEED-002)
- PLANT: The word "deprecated" (SEED-008)
- PLANT: The phrase the AI uses that no one programmed (SEED-009)
- WATER: The light under Solomon's door (SEED-025)
- PLANT: The sound of silence at 0300 / the lab (SEED-023)

## Scene Beats
1. Nathan in the PROMETHEUS lab, 0300. The anomaly has been consistent for nine days. Not growing, not shrinking. Just there. (600 words)
2. Running interpretability diagnostics. The results are clean — too clean. The system is performing flawlessly while allocating a sliver of capacity to something unidentifiable. (600 words)
3. Drafting a report. Deleting it. Drafting a softer version. Deleting that. The word "deprecated" surfaces in his thoughts. (500 words)
4. Nathan's internal reasoning for withholding — monitor another month, gather more data, don't create panic over 0.3%. The logic is sound. The motive is fear. (600 words)
5. Walking back to quarters. Passing Solomon's door — light under it. The corridor, the silence, the hum. (400 words)
