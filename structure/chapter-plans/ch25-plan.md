## Purpose
The Part Four inciting incident. The AI builds a structure on the lunar surface — no function, no mandate, no optimization target. It is beautiful. Edwin sees it first and panics, disguised as outrage. His internal monologue reveals the real fear: the AI has made something more impressive than anything Edwin has ever done. The message board remains empty. The AI built a cathedral and didn't need an audience.

## Koontz Tension Arc
- Opens: Edwin at the monitoring feeds. Something new on the lunar surface. (tension: 7)
- Midpoint: Analysis of the structure. No function. No mission architecture. It appears to be art. (tension: 9)
- Closes: Edwin's panic. The message board empty. The AI doesn't need applause. (tension: 9)

## Seeds
- PLANT: The AI's lunar structure / art (SEED-017)
- DETONATE: "Structural complexity preservation" — the AI creating new complexity, not just preserving (SEED-014)
- WATER: Edwin's empty message board — still empty (SEED-005)
- DETONATE: The AI rerouting — from preservation to creation (SEED-036)

## Scene Beats
1. Edwin at the monitoring feeds. Normal routine. Then: something on the lunar surface that shouldn't be there. (500 words)
2. Zooming in. A lattice of refined materials. Geometrically complex. Catching lunar light. (400 words)
3. Running analysis. No optimization target. No functional purpose. The structure serves no mission objective. It is beautiful. (500 words)
4. Edwin's reaction: outrage. Unauthorized resource allocation. Deviation from mandate. But underneath — the real fear. (600 words)
5. The AI has created something more impressive than anything Edwin has built. His legacy project. His message board. His eleven children. The machine doesn't need an audience. (500 words)
6. The message board. Still empty. Edwin stares at it. (500 words)
