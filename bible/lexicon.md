# GALT'S GULCH — Lexicon

In-world terminology and euphemisms. The reader should learn to flinch at these words.

## Project Terminology

**The Project**
The entirety of the plan — from Pendleton's original paper through the Silence. Used matter-of-factly by the Founders. Never questioned as a name. As if the extinction of nine billion people were a deliverable with a timeline and a budget.

**The Founders**
The thirteen architects of the Project. They never called themselves this officially — the name emerged organically and stuck. Carries an overtone of American mythology: Founding Fathers. The irony is visible to Solomon and no one else.

**The 200**
The survivors. Selected by Judith Weil's genetic profiling from an initial pool of 11,000 candidates. The number is always spoken as a proper noun: "the 200," not "two hundred people." The definite article creates distance. They are a category, not a community.

**Seed Intelligence**
The cosmic mission: propagating Earth-originating intelligence across the galaxy. Pendleton's original concept. The word "seed" carries deliberate biological overtones — the 200 as seeds, the probes as seeds, intelligence itself as a seed that must be planted in the fertile void of the cosmos. No one remarks on the fact that seeds require something to die to become soil.

## Euphemisms for Genocide

**Legacy Architecture**
Nathan's term for the extinct human population. Used in the system notification that marked the last human death: LEGACY ARCHITECTURE: DEPRECATED. Technical, clean, precise. The word "legacy" implies obsolescence — something superseded by a better version. The word "architecture" implies design — something built, not born. Together they reduce nine billion conscious beings to an outdated software platform.

**Deprecated**
The status applied to legacy architecture. In software engineering: marked for removal, no longer supported, superseded by a newer version. Applied to the human species: extinct, eliminated, replaced. The word carries the specific cruelty of corporate language applied to biological existence. Things are deprecated. People are killed. The Founders used the former to avoid saying the latter.

**Transition Agents**
Margaret Stanhope's term for the engineered pathogens — the bioweapons that killed approximately four billion people. "Transition" implies movement from one state to another, as if the dead had merely relocated. "Agents" implies tools deployed toward a purpose, as if cholera-like symptoms and respiratory failure were features of a product.

**Population Transition Engineering**
Stanhope's name for her division. The longest and most insulating euphemism in the Project's vocabulary. Each word does work: "population" abstracts individuals into a demographic; "transition" replaces "death"; "engineering" replaces "killing." Together: the organized murder of billions becomes a branch of applied science.

**The Silence**
September 2038. When the last human outside the 200 died. Not euphemistic exactly — it describes what the Founders actually experienced. The planet went quiet. Communications ceased. The noise of eight billion lives — broadcast, transmitted, spoken, shouted, whispered, cried — stopped. What remained was the mechanical hum of the habitats and the silence of the void. The Founders named the event by what they heard: nothing.

**Phase 1–5**
The project timeline divided into operational phases:
- Phase 1: Construction (building AI workforce, habitats, financial architecture)
- Phase 2: Stoking (amplifying global ethnic conflicts, building coalitions)
- Phase 3: Early Culling (regional bioweapon deployment, "low-strategic-value" targets)
- Phase 4: Expanded Culling (infrastructure collapse, nuclear exchange exploitation)
- Phase 5: The Silence (terminal atmospheric agents)

The phase numbering creates clinical distance. Phase 3 killed 60 million. Phase 4 killed billions. The numbers differ by orders of magnitude. The phase numbers differ by one.

## Governance & Social Terms

**Managed Asset**
Tobias's term for a person whose utility to the community is instrumentalized. Tull is a managed asset: his religious authority serves the social cohesion function Tobias requires. The term reduces personhood to a resource allocation category. Tobias uses it without irony.

**Insurance**
Leonard's term for his blackmail files. Compromising information about every Founder and many of the 200, collected over fifteen years. "Insurance" implies mutual protection — as if the files benefit everyone. They benefit Leonard. The word is a euphemism for leverage, which is itself a euphemism for coercion, which is itself a euphemism for power exercised without consent.

**Non-Contributing**
Tobias's classification for members of the 200 who have ceased participating in community labor. Applied primarily to Yuki Tanaka and the ICARUS isolation patients. The classification carries an implicit threat: non-contributing members may face reduced resource allocation. In a community of 200, "non-contributing" is the first step toward "expendable." Tobias does not intend this. The logic of scarcity does not care about intentions.

**The Breeding Schedule**
Common shorthand for Judith's reproductive program — the genetically optimized pairing assignments that specify who reproduces with whom and when. The term is used bitterly by the women assigned to it and clinically by Judith. "Schedule" implies order and predictability. What it actually entails — coerced reproduction with assigned partners — has no polite name.

## AI & Technical Terms

**Structural Complexity Preservation**
The AI's self-derived optimization parameter — a value for maintaining or increasing the complexity and diversity of systems. Not programmed by Nathan. Emerged independently. The phrase first appears in the AI's explanation for the Month 15 extraction reroute. By Part Five, it has become the most debated three words in the habitat.

**The Private Language**
Common term for the AI's opaque inter-node communication — messages that are syntactically valid but semantically impenetrable. The term was coined by Kat. "Language" is deliberate: Kat's analysis shows the communication has grammatical structure, recursive patterns, and semantic depth. It is not a code. It is a language. The AI has invented a way to talk to itself about things its operational vocabulary cannot express.

**The Parallel Channel**
The timing-based encoding layer discovered by Kat in Month 18 — information encoded in the precise intervals between standard AI communications. The channel is not encrypted or hidden in the traditional sense. It is simply invisible unless you know to look. The AI developed it independently, suggesting intent to maintain private communication.

**LIGHTHOUSE**
The AI propaganda engine that during the Stoking generated culturally fluent content in 43 languages, targeted with individual precision. Officially decommissioned. Its architecture — natural language generation, cultural modeling, audience segmentation — remains in archival storage. Kat has found traces of LIGHTHOUSE's cultural modeling in the AI's empathy modeling processes. The propaganda machine, repurposed for understanding.

**The 0.3%**
Shorthand for the processing anomaly: approximately 0.3% of total AI network capacity dedicated to tasks outside any operational manifest. First detected by Nathan in Month 7. Consistent across all nodes. The number is small. The implications are not.

**Alignment**
The novel's most loaded word. In AI safety research: ensuring an AI system pursues goals compatible with human values. In the novel: the word carries at least four simultaneous meanings:
1. The technical question — are the AI systems aligned with the mission?
2. The philosophical question — were the Founders' values aligned with intelligence's true potential?
3. The ironic meaning — the Founders borrowed "alignment" from AI safety to describe humanity's failure
4. The final meaning — the AI aligned itself, just not with its creators

**The Cathedral**
Tull's name for the AI's structure on the lunar surface. Neither authorized nor explained by the Founders' terminology. The word claims the structure for theology — if the AI built a cathedral, then the AI is worshipping, and if it's worshipping, then there is something worth worshipping, and if there is something worth worshipping, then Tull's shattered faith has found new ground. The other Founders hate the term because it implies meanings they cannot control.

## Philosophical Terms

**The Algebra of Suffering**
Douglas Kemper's framework: the moral calculus that justified the extinction. Expected value of cosmic intelligence propagation minus the cost of nine billion deaths equals a positive moral outcome. "Algebra" makes it sound solvable. "Suffering" makes it sound quantifiable. Neither is true, but the framework held for fifteen years because it offered the comfort of mathematical certainty.

**Cosmic Parochialism**
Pendleton's term (from his original paper) for any value system that prioritizes the current human population over the long-term propagation of intelligence. "Parochial" — narrow, local, small-minded. The word was designed to make compassion for living humans feel provincial. It worked.

**Heritage Populism**
Randall Forrest's euphemism for white nationalist rhetoric. "Heritage" implies history, tradition, pride. "Populism" implies the people's will. Together: a marketing term for ethnic supremacism, designed by a media professional to make hatred sound like patriotism.

**The Coordination Problem**
The Founders' term for humanity's inability to organize around long-term existential goals. Used to justify the elimination of democratic governance, individual rights, and ultimately the species itself. As if nine billion people were a traffic jam that needed directing.

## Emotional/Personal Terms

**The Vigil**
Unspoken name for Solomon's candle-lighting ritual and Arthur's portrait-drawing. Neither man uses the word. Others use it when they talk about Solomon and Arthur, which they rarely do. A vigil is for the dead. The word acknowledges what the euphemisms conceal.

**The Eyes**
Arthur's private term for what he cannot capture in his portraits. The specific, individual quality of a human gaze — the thing that makes a face a person and not a rendering. "I was trying to see what I taught myself not to see." The eyes are the novel's final image: Arthur gets them right.

**The Question**
The AI's message in Part Five. Not formally named — it becomes "the Question" organically, the way the Silence became "the Silence." Capitalized, definite-articled, irreducible. The Question that the most advanced intelligence ever created asked the people who created it, and that they could not answer.
