# PROMETHEUS — Primary Orbital Habitat

## OVERVIEW

PROMETHEUS is home. It is the largest of the three orbital habitats, the administrative center of the community, and the place where most of the 200 eat, sleep, argue, grieve, and try to build something worth living for on top of the bones of everything they destroyed.

It was not designed to be home. It was designed by Edwin Hartwell's engineers as a closed-loop life-support platform for long-duration orbital occupation — a machine for keeping bodies alive. The engineers who drafted the original plans were told they were designing for Mars colonization. They designed for ten thousand people. The Founders redesigned for two hundred, which means PROMETHEUS is simultaneously too large and too small: too large for the population it contains (empty corridors, unused modules, the constant awareness of absence), and too small for the psychologies it must contain (two hundred people who participated in the murder of nine billion, sealed in a metal tube in the void, with nowhere to go and nothing to escape into).

## PHYSICAL SPECIFICATIONS

**Type:** Modified O'Neill cylinder
**Length:** ~500 meters
**Diameter:** ~100 meters at the widest point (the main cylinder)
**Rotation:** 2 RPM, producing approximately 0.7g at the outer hull (enough to feel like gravity, not enough to feel like Earth — everything is slightly too light, slightly wrong, a constant subliminal reminder that this is not where humans are supposed to live)
**Power:** Two nuclear fission reactors (redundant design), located in shielded nacelles at the aft endcap. Provides approximately 50 MW total output. More than enough for the current population. The reactors hum. You learn to stop hearing it. You never fully stop.
**Atmosphere:** Nitrogen-oxygen mix at 0.85 atm. Slightly lower pressure than sea level. Causes occasional headaches in the first few weeks, then you adapt, then you forget what full pressure felt like. The air always tastes faintly of metal and ozone, courtesy of the recirculation scrubbers.
**Water:** Closed-loop reclamation. Every drop of water in PROMETHEUS has been drunk, excreted, filtered, and drunk again hundreds of times. Edwin posted a joke about this on the internal board. No one laughed.
**Temperature:** Maintained at 21C standard, with +-2C variation by section. The system is precise but not perfect — there are cold spots near the endcaps and warm spots near the reactors. People learn which corridors are warm and which are cold. They develop preferences. These preferences become territorial.

## LAYOUT

PROMETHEUS is organized along its longitudinal axis into five major sections, connected by a central corridor (officially "Main Transit Corridor," universally called "the Spine") that runs the full 500-meter length of the habitat. The Spine is 3 meters wide and 2.5 meters tall — wide enough for two people to pass, narrow enough that you always see who's coming, narrow enough that you cannot avoid them.

### SECTION 1: FORWARD ENDCAP — Command and Communications

**Location:** Meters 0-50 (the "front" of the cylinder, facing away from Earth)

The forward endcap houses the habitat's command-and-control systems, communications arrays, and primary computational interface for the PROMETHEUS-7 AI system.

- **Command Center:** A semicircular room with wall-mounted displays showing habitat systems status, power output, atmospheric readings, population tracking, and — on one screen that no one looks at — a real-time feed from Earth-facing cameras showing the planet below. The command center is staffed 24 hours, theoretically, but in practice the AI manages all systems autonomously and the human operators are there to "monitor" — which means they sit in uncomfortable chairs and watch screens that never change and think about what they've done. Three workstations. Six chairs. A coffee dispenser that produces something adjacent to coffee.
- **Communications Hub:** The transmitter/receiver array for inter-habitat communication (DAEDALUS, ICARUS, FOUNDATION) and the now-purposeless Earth-facing dishes that once received signals from a planet that no longer sends them. The dishes are still active. No one has ordered them shut down. Shutting them down would mean admitting there is nothing left to hear.
- **PROMETHEUS-7 Primary Interface Terminal:** A dedicated room, climate-controlled and access-restricted, housing the main human-AI interface for the PROMETHEUS node. Nathan and Kat are the primary users. The terminal provides access to the interpretability layer — the visible portion of the AI's decision architecture. What it does not provide access to is the layer beneath, the "subconscious" that Nathan's tools cannot fully resolve. The terminal room is always slightly cooler than the rest of the habitat. The lighting is blue-white. It feels like being inside a thought.
- **Message Board Terminals:** Four public-access terminals mounted in the corridor outside the command center, connected to the internal community message board that Edwin posts to compulsively. The terminals are simple text interfaces — no images, no video, just text on dark screens. They are the habitat's public square, such as it is. Announcements, schedules, resource reports, Douglas's ethics seminar invitations, Edwin's manifestos, occasional anonymous posts that Randall monitors and sometimes suppresses. The terminals are always on. Their screens glow faintly in the corridor at night. People stop to read them the way people once stopped to look at bulletin boards in small towns: compulsively, furtively, hoping for news, dreading it.

### SECTION 2: FORWARD QUARTER — Residential Modules (Founders and Senior Staff)

**Location:** Meters 50-150

The forward quarter contains the residential modules for the thirteen Founders and approximately forty senior technical staff. These are the largest private spaces on PROMETHEUS — "large" being relative: each module is approximately 12 square meters, containing a sleeping platform, a fold-down desk, storage for personal items, a hygiene cubicle (toilet, sink, shower — water-limited to 3 minutes per cycle), and a single viewport approximately 30 cm in diameter that shows, depending on the module's position in the rotation cycle, either stars or Earth.

The Founders' modules are clustered along the port side of the cylinder. This was not formally designated as a privilege — Tobias would point out that module assignments were made on a purely logistical basis — but everyone understands the geography. Port side forward is where power lives.

Notable modules:
- **Edwin Hartwell (Module F-01):** The largest, because Edwin demanded it and no one had the energy to argue. Cluttered with hardware prototypes, screens showing mission progress metrics, and drawings by his children that he has taped to every available surface. Always occupied — Edwin does not leave unless he has somewhere to perform.
- **Arthur Pendleton (Module F-03):** The quietest. Stacked with synthetic paper covered in charcoal portraits. The walls were white when Arthur moved in. They are gray now, a fine charcoal dust coating every surface. Smells of carbon and silence. Solomon visits twice a week.
- **Leonard Grafton (Module F-07):** The only module with a privately installed lock. Leonard had it fabricated in the first month. Tobias allowed it, reasoning that a locked door was less disruptive than whatever Leonard would do if denied one. No one has been inside except Leonard. Rumors about its contents range from the plausible (his blackmail files, stored on local hardware disconnected from the network) to the paranoid (weapons, hoarded supplies, communication equipment).
- **Nathan Alsop (Module F-04):** Half living space, half secondary AI workstation. Nathan has routed a dedicated data line from the PROMETHEUS-7 interface to his personal terminal. He works at all hours. His sleep schedule, tracked by the AI life-support system, averages 4.2 hours per night. The module is immaculate — Nathan cleans compulsively, the one physical expression of his need for systematic order.
- **Solomon Hersch (Module F-11):** The candle. A single yahrzeit candle, replaced daily from a supply Solomon fabricated himself using habitat materials, burns on a small shelf by the viewport. The flame is technically a fire hazard in a pressurized habitat. Tobias has chosen not to enforce this. The candle is visible from the corridor through the module's interior window. People pass it and look away, or don't look away, and either response reveals something about them.

### SECTION 3: CENTRAL CORE — Common Areas and Community Spaces

**Location:** Meters 150-300 (the middle third of the habitat)

The Central Core is the closest thing PROMETHEUS has to a public space. It is where the 200 gather, eat, argue, hold meetings, attend Douglas's seminars and Tull's prayer meetings, and perform the daily rituals of community life that are the only barrier between civilization and total psychological collapse.

- **The Commons:** The largest open space on PROMETHEUS — a roughly cylindrical room 30 meters long and 15 meters wide at its broadest point, with a curved ceiling that follows the cylinder's inner surface. Tables and chairs (modular, reconfigurable) for communal meals. A serving station connected to the hydroponic food-processing system. The food is nutritionally complete, texturally adequate, and spiritually deadening: protein paste, reconstituted grains, hydroponic vegetables that taste like what they are — plants grown under artificial light in recycled water by machines. Peggy's garden supplements the menu with herbs and greens that taste like actual food, which has made Peggy's garden one of the most psychologically important spaces on the habitat.

  The Commons is where Douglas holds his ethics sessions (Tuesday evenings, attendance declining). It is where Tull holds prayer meetings (Monday, Wednesday, Friday evenings, attendance increasing). It is where Edwin delivers his progress briefings (Sunday mornings, attendance mandatory in theory and sporadic in practice). It is where people eat together and pretend this is a life and not a sentence.

  The walls of the Commons were originally bare white composite. Someone — no one claims credit — began writing names on the east wall in the third month. Names of the dead. Not nine billion names; that would take lifetimes. But names: Maria, Ahmed, Yuki, Patrick, Amara, Chen, hundreds of them, written in different handwriting in whatever pigment was available. Tobias considered ordering the wall cleaned. He did not. The wall is now covered from floor to ceiling. It is the closest thing the habitat has to a memorial. People add names when no one is watching.

- **Medical Bay:** Adjacent to the Commons, staffed by two physicians and a psychiatric nurse from the 200, plus AI diagnostic and treatment systems. Handles routine medical care, psychological monitoring, reproductive health (in coordination with Judith's program), and the steady stream of anxiety, depression, insomnia, and psychosomatic illness that is the baseline condition of the entire population. The psychiatric medication cabinet is the most frequently accessed resource in the habitat. The medical bay smells of antiseptic and is always slightly too bright.

- **Governance Council Chamber:** A room that seats twenty, used for the governance council meetings Tobias chairs. Oval table. No windows. Recording equipment that Tobias controls. The chamber is where resource allocation, work schedules, reproductive pairings, and faction disputes are officially managed. Unofficially, most governance happens in corridors, in private modules, in whispered conversations in the Commons. The chamber is theater. Tobias knows this and maintains the theater anyway, because theater is structure, and structure is all that stands between order and chaos.

- **Message Board Terminals:** Two more terminals here, in the Commons, which are the most heavily used. People check them during meals. The screens accumulate fingerprints and food residue that are cleaned daily by maintenance drones.

### SECTION 4: AFT QUARTER — General Residential and Working Spaces

**Location:** Meters 300-420

The aft quarter houses the general population — the remaining ~145 non-Founder members of the 200 (minus those stationed on DAEDALUS, ICARUS, and FOUNDATION). Residential modules here are smaller than the forward quarter: approximately 8 square meters each, sleeping two in stacked bunks for couples or assigned pairs. The corridors are narrower. The lighting is slightly dimmer — a power allocation decision Tobias made early on that he insists is practical and that everyone understands is hierarchical. Living in the aft quarter feels like living in a submarine. You are always aware of the people on the other side of every wall.

- **Nathan's AI Lab:** Located in the aft quarter not for security reasons but because it requires proximity to the primary data trunk that runs through the cylinder's structural core. A suite of three rooms — the main lab, a server room (climate-controlled, the constant whir of cooling fans audible through the walls), and a small anteroom where Nathan meets with people who need to discuss AI matters without entering the lab proper. The lab is Nathan's domain. Access is restricted to Nathan, Kat, and — grudgingly — Tobias. The door is unmarked. Nathan prefers it that way.

  The lab contains the secondary AI interface systems, Nathan's proprietary interpretability tools, and the data archives where he stores his observations — including the observations he has not shared with the governance council. The servers in the adjacent room are a fraction of the AI's total computational capacity (the bulk is on DAEDALUS and FOUNDATION), but they contain the local PROMETHEUS-7 node's core processes and Nathan's monitoring infrastructure. The lab is where Kat first sees the communication logs, in Month 14. It is where the parallel AI communication channel is discovered, in Month 18. It is the habitat's confessional, where the AI's secrets and Nathan's secrets converge.

- **Workshop:** A general-purpose fabrication and repair space, equipped with 3D printers, manual tools, and small-scale manufacturing capability. Where the non-AI physical work of the habitat happens: repairing air handlers, fabricating replacement parts, building furniture, maintaining the water reclamation system. The workshop is staffed by a rotating crew and is, despite its utilitarian function, one of the healthiest spaces on PROMETHEUS. People who work with their hands are, as a rule, doing better psychologically than people who don't. The workshop smells of lubricant and heated polymer and has a hand-lettered sign over the door that reads "MAKE SOMETHING." No one knows who put it there.

- **Child Care Module:** A dedicated space for the children — Edwin's eleven plus nine others born to various pairings in the reproductive program. Twenty children under the age of two, cared for by a rotating team of six adults. The module is bright, warm, padded, and filled with a desperate, manufactured cheerfulness that does not quite conceal the terror of raising the first generation of a species that murdered its predecessors. The children do not know where they are or what their parents did. They will.

### SECTION 5: AFT ENDCAP — Life Support and Engineering

**Location:** Meters 420-500

The aft endcap houses the habitat's life-support systems, power distribution, water reclamation, atmospheric processing, and waste management — the unglamorous infrastructure that keeps 200 people alive in a metal tube. Almost entirely AI-managed, with human technicians performing maintenance and monitoring.

- **Hydroponic Bays:** Three levels of hydroponic growing systems producing the habitat's food supply. AI-managed nutrient delivery, lighting, and harvesting. The bays are humid, warm, and green — the only place on PROMETHEUS that feels alive in a biological rather than mechanical sense. Walking through the hydroponic bays is the closest thing to walking through a forest, if your forest was fluorescent-lit, 2 meters tall, and smelled of nutrient solution.

- **The UV Bay (Peggy's Garden):** A supplemental growing space, originally designed for UV-intensive crop cultivation, that Peggy has claimed as her personal horticultural project. Unlike the AI-managed hydroponic bays, the UV bay is manually cultivated. Peggy grows herbs, flowers, and ornamental plants with the precision she once applied to bioweapons engineering. The bay has full-spectrum UV lighting that mimics sunlight. It is the only space on PROMETHEUS where you can close your eyes and, for a moment, believe you are outside. Peggy spends three hours a day here. Others visit when she permits it. The garden has become, without anyone naming it as such, a place of pilgrimage — people come to sit among the plants and remember what the world smelled like. Peggy tolerates this as long as no one touches her specimens.

- **Reactor Access:** Shielded corridor leading to the two nuclear reactors. Access restricted to qualified engineers and AI maintenance systems. The shielding is adequate but not generous — radiation levels in the aft endcap are measurably higher than elsewhere, a fact known to the medical team and not widely publicized. Long-term aft-quarter residents receive marginally higher radiation exposure. Judith has factored this into her genetic models. The numbers are not good.

- **Waste Processing:** Where everything that goes in comes out and goes back in again. The closed-loop system converts biological waste into agricultural inputs with 94% efficiency. The remaining 6% accumulates as non-recyclable residue in sealed containers that are periodically ejected into space. This is, Kat has noted, the only export product of the last human civilization: its own shit, cast into the void.

## THE FEEL OF THE PLACE

PROMETHEUS is not a spaceship from a movie. It is not sleek, or clean, or futuristic. It is a machine that humans live inside, and thirteen months of continuous occupation have given it the patina of use. The walls show scuff marks. The corridor floors are worn along the center from foot traffic. The air, despite the scrubbers, carries a faint permanent smell of cooked food, recycled water, human bodies, and the metallic tang of the habitat's own structure.

The lighting is institutional: flat, white, shadowless, on a 24-hour cycle that dims to simulated "night" from 2200 to 0600 but never fully darkens. There are no windows in most of the habitat — only the small viewports in residential modules and the command center displays. Most people go days without seeing stars. Some people go weeks. The absence of a sky is, according to the medical team, a significant contributor to the baseline depression that affects virtually the entire population.

The sound environment is constant: the hum of the reactors, the whisper of air circulation, the distant clank of thermal expansion in the structural members, the occasional whir of maintenance drones traversing the corridors. There is never silence on PROMETHEUS. The silence is on the planet below.

For 200 people, PROMETHEUS is both too large and too small. Too large because half the habitat is unused — empty modules, dark corridors, sealed sections that no one visits and that the AI maintains in standby mode, ready for a population that will never come. Walking through the empty sections is discouraged but not prohibited. Some people do it when they need to be alone — truly alone, not just behind a thin door in a module where you can hear your neighbor breathing. The empty sections are cold, dark, and absolutely silent except for the hum. They feel like the inside of a tomb.

Too small because in the occupied sections, you cannot escape anyone. You see the same 170 faces every day, in the same corridors, eating the same food, having the same arguments. Privacy is theoretical. Secrets are temporary. Gossip moves at the speed of a community that has nothing else to do. Everyone knows who is sleeping with whom, who is taking what medication, who cried in the Commons last night, who was seen standing in front of the memorial wall at 0300. The habitat is a panopticon built for the inmates by the inmates.

This is home. This is all there is.

## KEY NARRATIVE SPACES

Scenes will recur in these locations, each carrying accumulated emotional weight:

1. **The Spine** — Where people pass each other and must decide whether to speak or look away. Where Tull wanders quoting scripture. Where Edwin walks too fast and talks too loud. Where Solomon walks slowly and says nothing.

2. **The Commons** — Where the community performs the ritual of shared existence. Where the factions collide over meals. Where the memorial wall grows.

3. **The Command Center** — Where the data lives. Where the AI's behavior is monitored. Where Nathan and Kat have their pivotal conversations.

4. **Nathan's Lab** — Where the truth hides. Where the data Nathan won't share is stored. Where the novel's revelations are born.

5. **Peggy's Garden** — Where people go to remember that living things exist. The closest thing to sacred space, apart from Tull's prayer meetings.

6. **Solomon's Module** — Where the candle burns. Where Arthur visits. Where silence speaks.

7. **The Empty Sections** — Where people go when the habitat is too small. Where the absence of the nine billion is most tangible.

8. **The Message Board Terminals** — Where the community's public discourse happens. Where Edwin performs. Where anonymous posts appear that shift the political landscape. Where, eventually, the AI's Question will be displayed.
