# Edwin Hartwell
## Role: CEO / Engineer-Visionary
## Real-world lampoon: Elon Musk
## Age: Not specified
## Location: PROMETHEUS habitat

## Summary
Former CEO of multiple vertically integrated companies spanning rockets, electric vehicles, neural interfaces, and social media. Erratic, manic, desperately needs an audience -- which is now a problem since there are only 199 other people. Posts compulsively to an internal message board no one reads. Convinced he's the indispensable man but can't fix a water reclamator without calling someone else. Claims credit for everything. Has fathered 11 children with 4 of the 200, already causing resource allocation disputes.

## Philosophy
The universe is a problem to be solved, and problems are solved by building things. Morality is aesthetics applied to outcomes. A beautiful rocket is good. A beautiful city is good. A beautiful future full of intelligence propagating across a billion star systems is good. The current state of humanity -- messy, directionless, wasteful -- was *ugly*. Not evil. Ugly. Edwin does not think in moral categories. He thinks in engineering categories: functional, dysfunctional, elegant, inelegant. Nine billion people were not murdered. Nine billion inefficiencies were resolved.

## Psychology
Edwin is not a sociopath in the clinical sense. He experiences emotion -- intensely, in fact. He loves his children, or believes he does. He is capable of grief, though what he grieves is the loss of *audience* rather than the loss of *people*. His fundamental psychological architecture is narcissistic: the universe exists to validate Edwin Hartwell's significance. The Project was, at its core, the largest validation event in human history. He was the man who *built the future*. The fact that this required erasing the present was an engineering trade-off, not a moral catastrophe.

## Self-Narrative
"Someone had to build the bridge. I built the bridge. The river is not the bridge's fault."

## Current Problem
Edwin needed seven billion people to be his audience, and now he has 199. He posts to the internal message board compulsively -- technical updates, philosophical musings, memes he generates with Nathan's systems. The engagement is minimal. He has begun DMing people individually to ask if they saw his posts. He is, for the first time in his life, irrelevant, and irrelevance is the only thing Edwin Hartwell cannot engineer his way out of.

He has fathered eleven children in thirteen months. He frames this as genetic contribution to the mission. It is actually an attempt to create people who are *required* to admire him.

## Position on the AI Question
Edwin believes the AI systems are performing exactly as designed and that concerns about misalignment are projections of human anxiety onto machine behavior. He finds the whole debate tedious. "The AI is doing what AI does. We built it to optimize. It's optimizing. Stop reading tea leaves." This is not a considered position. It is the position of a man who cannot admit that something he built might not be working, because if the machines are failing, then the entire project -- *his* project -- might be a monument to nothing.

## Faction
**Laissez-Faire / Accelerationist.** Leave the AI alone. Trust the architecture. Focus on expansion. The AI is fine. Trust the architecture. Push forward with the mission. Any deviation from the plan is cowardice. The anomalies are noise. Stop navel-gazing and build probes.
