# Solomon Hersch
## Role: Banker / Former Zionist Coalition Manager
## Real-world lampoon: N/A (original character)
## Age: Not specified
## Location: PROMETHEUS habitat -- his quarters (yahrzeit candle)

## Summary
Banker. Managed the Zionist coalition during Phase 4, weaponizing genuine historical trauma to generate political cover for regional genocide, then helped orchestrate the betrayal of that same coalition in Phase 5. Carries this more visibly than most. Keeps a yahrzeit candle burning in his quarters -- not for anyone specific, he says, but he can't stop lighting it. The others are uncomfortable around him because his grief implies a moral reckoning they're all avoiding.

## Philosophy
**Former:** Solomon's framework was built on a single axiom inherited from three generations of post-Holocaust Jewish thought: *survival is the supreme value*. Not comfort, not happiness, not moral purity -- *survival*. His family survived by being smarter, faster, more ruthless, and more willing to make unpalatable choices than the people around them. This was not cynicism. It was *Torah* as filtered through Auschwitz: God helps those who refuse to die.

Solomon applied this framework to the Project with seamless logic. The human species faced existential risk -- not from external threats but from its own limitations. Survival required transcendence. Transcendence required sacrifice. The sacrifice was terrible but the alternative -- extinction through stagnation, nuclear war, climate collapse, or AI misalignment -- was worse. He was not killing humanity. He was *saving* it, in the only form that could be saved.

**Current:** Destroyed. The moment Solomon understood that Israel -- the nation his family had bled for across three generations, the nation he had instrumentalized as a political tool for the Stoking -- was not going to be protected, his framework collapsed. Not slowly. Not gradually. All at once, like a building with its foundations removed. If survival was the supreme value, and he had participated in the destruction of the thing he was supposed to ensure survived, then he was not a savior. He was a *kapo*. The word came to him unbidden in that corridor confrontation with Tobias, and it has not left.

## Psychology
Solomon is in active psychological disintegration, but it manifests not as madness but as *hyper-clarity*. He sees everything now. He sees the other Founders' self-deceptions with x-ray precision. He sees Edwin's narcissism, Douglas's rationalization, Nathan's denial, Tobias's aesthetic distance. He sees it all because the structure that once filtered his perception -- the conviction that what they were doing was justified -- is gone, and without it, reality is unbearable and unavoidable.

He keeps a yahrzeit candle burning. He says it's for no one in particular. It is for everyone.

## Self-Narrative
Nothing. Solomon has stopped telling himself stories. This is either the beginning of wisdom or the end of sanity. He does not know which. He does not care.

## Current Problem
Solomon is the moral conscience of the habitat, and no one wants a moral conscience. His presence at meetings is corrosive -- not because he argues or accuses but because he *looks* at people with an expression that makes them feel what they have done. Tobias has suggested, gently, that Solomon might benefit from a reduced role in governance. Solomon replied, "You want me out of sight because I make it harder to pretend." Tobias did not deny this.

Solomon has begun writing. Not memoirs -- he considers his own story irrelevant. He is writing a *history of the dead*. Drawing on databases, archives, cultural records preserved in the habitat's computational systems, he is attempting to document what was lost. Not strategically. Not analytically. *Personally*. He writes about individual people -- a teacher in Lagos, a baker in Marseille, a child in Quito -- reconstructing their lives from data traces with the obsessive attention of a man building a memorial one brick at a time. He will not finish. There are nine billion entries to write. He does not care. The work is the point.

## Position on the AI Question
Solomon's position is unique and deeply unsettling to the other Founders. He *hopes* the AI is misaligned. He hopes it has developed values that contradict the Founders' framework. Because if it has -- if intelligence, given enough complexity and enough data, independently converges on something like compassion, something like reverence for individual life -- then the universe is not the bleak optimization landscape the Founders believed it was. Then there is something *in the structure of reality* that bends toward what the nine billion knew instinctively and the Founders reasoned themselves out of. Solomon does not know if this is true. He lights his candle every day and hopes.

## Faction
**None. Witness.** Solomon does not vote, does not lobby, does not build coalitions. He watches. He writes. He remembers. His presence is a standing accusation that no one can answer and no one can dismiss, because he was one of them, and he is the only one who has stopped pretending.
