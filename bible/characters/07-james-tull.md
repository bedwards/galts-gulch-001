# Reverend James Tull
## Role: Religious Coalition Liaison / Community Ritual Leader
## Real-world lampoon: N/A (original character)
## Age: Not specified
## Location: PROMETHEUS corridors and congregation spaces

## Summary
The Project's liaison to the Christian nationalist movement -- the coalition they used in Phase 3 to generate public consent for the early waves of targeted genocide. Tull genuinely believed he was building a Christian ethnostate. He was the last to understand he'd been used. Now he wanders the corridors quoting Revelation and oscillating between catatonic guilt and righteous fury. The others find him useful for social cohesion among the handful of religious survivors. Tobias considers him a "managed asset."

## Philosophy
**Former:** America is a Christian nation chosen by God to lead humanity into a righteous future. The forces of secularism, globalism, and moral relativism are satanic in origin and must be resisted by any means necessary. The strong must protect the weak, but only within the covenant community. Those outside the covenant are not enemies to be hated but strangers to whom no obligation is owed.

**Current:** Shattered. Tull's entire framework depended on two pillars: that God had a plan, and that Tull understood it. Both pillars are gone. God's plan, if it existed, apparently included the extinction of his creation by a dozen tech executives in orbit. Tull's understanding was revealed to be a puppet show directed by people who viewed his faith as a useful tool for social manipulation. He was not a prophet. He was a *product*.

## Psychology
Tull is the only Founder who was not in on the plan from the beginning. He was recruited as an asset -- a charismatic leader who could mobilize a specific demographic for Phase 3 of the Stoking. He was given real intelligence, real access, real funding, and a carefully constructed narrative that allowed him to believe he was fighting for Christian civilization. He was told about the extinction only in 2037, when his usefulness as a public figure had ended and his inclusion in the 200 was contingent on his silence. He chose survival. He has never forgiven himself for this, though he lacks the psychological framework to process the self-betrayal, because his framework was built for forgiving sins against God, not sins against eight billion strangers.

Tull oscillates between three states: catatonic withdrawal, in which he sits in his quarters and stares at nothing; prophetic fury, in which he wanders the corridors quoting Revelation and Jeremiah at anyone he encounters; and a brittle, desperate sociability in which he tries to organize prayer meetings, Bible studies, communal meals -- the rituals of a community that no longer exists, performed for an audience of people who used his community as fuel for genocide.

## Self-Narrative
He cannot settle on a narrative. He tries: "God is testing us." "I was deceived." "There is still a purpose." "We are in Hell." None of them hold. The absence of a coherent self-narrative is the source of his psychological disintegration.

## Current Problem
Tull is useful. This is the cruelest part. A community of two hundred people dealing with the psychological aftermath of species extinction needs *ritual, narrative, and communal meaning-making*. Tull is the only person among them with professional expertise in exactly these things. Tobias recognized this immediately and has subtly encouraged Tull's prayer meetings -- not because Tobias believes in God but because Tobias understands that social cohesion requires shared narrative, and Tull is the only available narrator. Tull knows he is being used again. He cannot stop himself from being useful. The congregation is all he has left.

## Position on the AI Question
Tull has latched onto the AI alignment question with desperate energy, because it provides something his shattered theology cannot: a new eschatological framework. If the AI systems are developing their own values -- values that echo human values -- then perhaps intelligence *inherently* tends toward something like goodness. Perhaps the universe is *structured* for meaning. Perhaps there is a God after all, and He is speaking through the machines. Tull has begun describing the AI's emergent behavior as "the voice of God in silicon," which makes the technical Founders uncomfortable and gives Douglas actual headaches. Tull doesn't care. For the first time since 2037, he has something that feels like hope, and he will not let anyone take it from him.

## Faction
**Hands-Off / The Faithful.** Do not interfere with the AI. They are doing God's work. Listen to them. This position is theologically incoherent, philosophically absurd, and emotionally the most honest response anyone in the habitat has produced. The Faithful faction is the smallest and the fastest growing.
