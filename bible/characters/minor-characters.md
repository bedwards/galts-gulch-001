# Minor Characters Among the 200

These are the named supporting characters who provide human-scale texture to the community. They appear in background, in passing, in other characters' POV chapters. They make the world feel populated and provide concrete consequences for the Founders' decisions.

## 1. Dr. Rena Okafor
**Role:** Chief Medical Officer / Psychiatrist
**Age:** 44
**Location:** PROMETHEUS medical bay
**Profile:** Nigerian-British. The only psychiatrist among the 200. Sees patients twelve hours a day, dispensing medication and documenting psychological collapse with clinical precision. Keeps detailed case files that Tobias has requested access to (she refused). Chain-smokes synthetic cigarettes she fabricates in the chem lab. The most sleep-deprived person in the habitat. Has started talking to herself in the corridors at night — clinical observations, dictated to no one.

## 2. Marco Vasquez
**Role:** Life Support Chief Engineer
**Age:** 52
**Location:** PROMETHEUS engineering deck
**Profile:** Mexican-American. The man who actually keeps everyone alive — water reclamation, air filtration, thermal regulation, waste processing. Neither a Founder nor a philosopher. Increasingly resentful of the people who decided the 200 should exist, because he's the one who has to make the existence *work*. Has a dry, bitter humor. When Edwin posts about the grand mission, Marco replies with maintenance logs. No one notices except Kat, who finds them funnier than Edwin's posts.

## 3. Lena Hartwell (née Sorensen)
**Role:** Mother of three of Edwin's children / Botanist
**Age:** 31
**Location:** PROMETHEUS residential module
**Profile:** Danish. One of the four women Edwin has fathered children with. Selected for the 200 as a botanist. Works with Peggy in the UV bay but they don't speak — Lena tends food crops, Peggy tends ornamentals, and the three meters between their workstations contains more silence than the vacuum outside. Loves her children with a ferocity that frightens her. Does not love Edwin. Has never loved Edwin. Was assigned to him by Judith's reproductive program.

## 4. Ezra and Noor Hadid
**Role:** The couple who fell in love after the Silence
**Ages:** 34 (Ezra), 29 (Noor)
**Location:** PROMETHEUS residential module
**Profile:** He's Israeli-American, she's Lebanese-Canadian. They met three months after the Silence and fell in love in a way that makes everyone else uncomfortable — not because it's inappropriate but because it's *genuine*. They are the only people in the habitat who seem happy, and their happiness is an accusation that no one can articulate. Ezra was a structural engineer. Noor was a data analyst. They want to have children on their own timeline, not Judith's.

## 5. Yuki Tanaka
**Role:** The Refuser
**Age:** 38
**Location:** ICARUS, Module 7
**Profile:** Japanese. Systems analyst. Stopped participating four months after the Silence. Doesn't attend meetings, doesn't contribute labor, doesn't speak. Lives in a module on ICARUS and eats the rations delivered to her door. Tobias has classified her as "non-contributing" and proposed reducing her resource allocation. Kat visits her weekly. They sit in silence — a different kind of silence than Arthur and Solomon's, younger and angrier. Yuki is not catatonic. She is *refusing*. The distinction matters, though only Kat understands why.

## 6. Thomas "Tommy" Hartwell
**Role:** Edwin's eldest child / The child who will ask questions
**Age:** 18 months at novel's start (born Month -5, conceived pre-Silence)
**Location:** PROMETHEUS nursery / residential module
**Profile:** Edwin's firstborn. Toddling by Part Three, speaking first words by Part Five. His existence is a constant reminder of the future the Founders claim to be building. When Douglas holds Tommy during an ethics seminar, the audience watches Douglas hold a child in a room where they're debating whether killing nine billion people was justified, and several people leave. Tommy's first recognizable word, in Part Five, is "why."

## 7. Sergeant Alma Cruz
**Role:** Buck's second-in-command / Security
**Age:** 36
**Location:** ICARUS armory / patrols all habitats
**Profile:** Filipina-American. Former Marine, then Patterson's private military. Follows Buck's orders without question, but unlike Buck, she never stopped asking questions internally. She just learned to keep them to herself. Has started attending Tull's prayer meetings — not out of faith but because she needs something that isn't an order. Buck doesn't know. If he found out, he'd consider it a security concern.

## 8. Dr. Vikram Patel
**Role:** Reproductive program physician / Judith's reluctant assistant
**Age:** 47
**Location:** PROMETHEUS medical lab
**Profile:** Indian-British. OB-GYN and geneticist. Works under Judith on the reproductive program and has begun to suspect the data is falsified. Hasn't confronted her because he's not sure, and because confronting Judith Weil is like confronting a glacier — technically possible but practically pointless. Keeps his own records. Drinks tea at precise intervals. The most quietly observant person in the habitat after Solomon.

## 9. Pastor David Liu
**Role:** Tull's most devoted congregant / emerging lay leader
**Age:** 41
**Location:** PROMETHEUS common area (chapel space)
**Profile:** Chinese-American. Former tech executive who found religion during the Stoking. Was recruited into the 200 as a logistics specialist but has increasingly devoted himself to Tull's congregation. Unlike Tull, David's faith was not instrumentalized by the Founders — he came to it independently, which gives it a resilience Tull's faith lacks. After Tull's death, David will inherit the congregation, and what he does with it will matter.

## 10. Iris Pendleton
**Role:** Arthur's caretaker / nurse
**Age:** 55
**Location:** PROMETHEUS, Arthur's residential module
**Profile:** African-American. Registered nurse. Assigned to monitor Arthur's health but has become something closer to a companion. She is the person who sees his portraits first — every day, a new stack of faces. She has started organizing them, giving them numbers, storing them carefully. She does not know why this feels important. Arthur has never asked her to. She has never told him she does it. It is the quietest collaboration in the habitat, and possibly the most meaningful.
