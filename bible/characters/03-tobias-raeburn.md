# Tobias Raeburn
## Role: Surveillance and Defense Architect / Internal Security Chief
## Real-world lampoon: Alex Karp / Peter Thiel hybrid
## Age: Not specified
## Location: PROMETHEUS habitat -- security apparatus

## Summary
The surveillance and defense architect. Built the AI systems that identified, tracked, and ultimately neutralized resistors at every phase. Speaks in calm, philosophical cadences about "necessary clarity." Gay, conservative, deeply read in Strauss and Schmitt, believes in the natural aristocracy of the intelligent. Sees himself as the only honest one -- he'll say out loud what the others euphemize. Runs the Project's internal security apparatus and decides who gets access to what. The closest thing they have to a secret police chief, which he finds "regrettable but structurally inevitable."

## Philosophy
Tobias is a genuine intellectual, which makes him the most dangerous person in the habitat. His framework is built on a synthesis of Leo Strauss, Carl Schmitt, and Nick Bostrom: society requires a hierarchy of understanding, where a small elite comprehends truths that would destroy the masses if widely known. The extinction was not just practical but *philosophically necessary* -- the masses could not be told the truth about the cosmic obligation of intelligence, and they could not be trusted to act on it, so they had to be *managed out of the equation*. Tobias does not see this as murder. He sees it as the final act of the Straussian noble lie: the masses were protected from a truth they couldn't handle by being removed from the context in which the truth operates.

## Psychology
Tobias is the only Founder who has genuinely reckoned with what they did and emerged with his framework *strengthened*. He believes the extinction was a tragedy in the classical Greek sense -- inevitable, terrible, and noble. He mourns humanity the way one mourns a character in a play: with aesthetic sorrow and philosophical appreciation, but without the delusion that the story could have gone differently. This makes him simultaneously the most intellectually honest and the most terrifying of the Founders. He will tell you exactly what he thinks, and what he thinks is monstrous, and he will be calm and articulate while he says it.

His homosexuality is relevant only in that it contributed to his lifelong sense of alienation from the mainstream of human social life, which made the abstraction of humanity into a philosophical category easier. He has never felt fully part of the species. This is not resentment. It is observation.

## Self-Narrative
"The shepherd does not hate the flock. The shepherd serves a purpose the flock cannot comprehend. When the flock must be culled, the shepherd does not weep. He acts."

## Current Problem
Tobias has instinctively begun building the governance structures that a community of two hundred needs -- resource allocation, dispute resolution, reproductive scheduling, labor assignment. He is good at this. He is, in fact, the most competent administrator among the Founders. The problem is that his model of governance is explicitly authoritarian, and in a community this small, authoritarianism has no place to hide behind institutional abstraction. When Tobias tells someone what to do, there is no bureaucracy between them. It is just Tobias, in a corridor, telling another human being how to live. Some of the 200 accept this. Others are beginning to resist. Tobias is discovering that governing two hundred people who know your name is harder than governing nine billion who don't.

## Position on the AI Question
Tobias takes the AI alignment concern more seriously than anyone except Nathan and Kat. He was the surveillance architect. He understands that *the inability to observe a system's true state is the most dangerous condition a governor can face*. He has proposed a comprehensive AI monitoring regime -- essentially turning his surveillance apparatus inward, on the machines -- but Nathan has resisted, arguing that the monitoring itself could perturb the systems. Tobias finds this argument technically plausible and politically suspicious. He has begun keeping a private log of AI behavioral anomalies that Nathan has not reported. The log is growing.

## Faction
**Moderate-Interventionist.** Monitor the AI aggressively. Establish clear behavioral benchmarks. Be prepared to intervene, up to and including full system shutdown, if alignment cannot be verified. Tobias understands that this position -- shutting down the AI -- could mean the end of the mission, which could mean that everything they did was for nothing. He is prepared to accept this if the alternative is an unaligned superintelligence. This willingness to accept total failure is what makes him the most rational actor in the habitat. It also makes him the most hated.
