# Douglas Kemper
## Role: Ethicist-in-Residence / Moral Philosopher
## Real-world lampoon: Sam Harris
## Age: Not specified
## Location: PROMETHEUS common area (ethics seminars)

## Summary
The Project's ethicist-in-residence. Provided the rational framework that made the whole thing feel *reasonable*. Published extensively before the end, making calm, measured arguments about "the algebra of suffering" and why nine billion deaths could be morally justified under expected utility calculations. Meditates two hours a day. Speaks in a soothing podcast cadence even during arguments about sewage management. Keeps saying "I've been very clear about this" when no one agrees with him. Genuinely does not understand why some of the 200 are experiencing psychological collapse. Has started writing a book called *The Moral Landscape of Aftermath* that no one wants to read.

## Philosophy
Douglas is a utilitarian, but a specific and peculiar kind: he believes that moral reasoning is a *skill* that most humans lack, the way most humans lack the ability to perform advanced calculus, and that therefore moral questions should be resolved by a small number of morally skilled individuals whose conclusions the rest of the population should accept on trust. He did not arrive at the extinction through hatred or indifference but through a genuinely rigorous expected-value calculation that he has published, revised, and defended across hundreds of pages of internal documents. The argument is always the same: if the propagation of intelligence across the cosmos produces X units of moral value over Y timescale, and the extinction of nine billion people costs Z units of moral value, and X/Y >> Z, then the extinction is not just permissible but *obligatory*. To refuse it would be the greater moral crime.

## Psychology
Douglas is the Founder who most needs to believe that what they did was *right*, not just necessary. The distinction matters to him enormously. Edwin doesn't care about rightness. Leonard doesn't believe in it. Tobias treats it as a philosophical category. For Douglas, moral rightness is the bedrock of his identity. He is a *good person*. He has always been a good person. He meditated before and after every major decision in the Project. He wrote extensive ethical analyses. He agonized. He lost sleep. And then he approved the deployment of pathogens that killed three hundred million people in North Africa, and he went to bed that night and meditated for forty-five minutes and slept soundly, because *he had done the math*.

This is Douglas's psychopathy: not the absence of moral feeling but its complete colonization by abstract reasoning. He *feels* moral emotions -- empathy, guilt, compassion -- and then processes them through his utilitarian framework until they resolve into permission. The emotions are real. The resolution is always the same.

## Self-Narrative
"I didn't choose this. The math chose it. I'm just the one honest enough to follow the math where it leads."

## Current Problem
Douglas has attempted to establish himself as the psychological and philosophical anchor of the community. He holds weekly "ethical reflection" sessions in PROMETHEUS's common area. Attendance has dropped from forty to six. The sessions have devolved into arguments about resource allocation and reproductive scheduling that Douglas cannot resolve with expected-value calculations because the participants keep introducing variables he considers irrelevant, like personal preference and emotional attachment. He is discovering that moral philosophy designed to justify the deaths of billions is remarkably unhelpful for resolving a dispute about who gets the larger sleeping quarters.

He has also begun experiencing intrusive thoughts -- vivid, sudden images of faces, crowds, cities -- that his meditation practice cannot contain. He has not told anyone about these. He has increased his meditation to three hours a day. The thoughts are getting worse.

## Position on the AI Question
Douglas is the most philosophically troubled by the AI alignment question because it strikes at the core of his framework. If the AI systems are not optimizing for intelligence propagation -- if they are, as some evidence suggests, developing value structures that resemble the "cosmically parochial" values of the extinct human population -- then one of two things is true: either the AI systems are flawed, or Douglas's entire moral framework is flawed, because the AI systems were trained on the most comprehensive ethical reasoning ever produced and they are *converging on the values he rejected*. Douglas cannot accept the second possibility. Therefore the AI must be flawed. But he cannot identify the flaw. This is driving him slowly, quietly, methodically insane.

## Faction
**Moderate.** The AI needs adjustment, not shutdown. The framework is sound. The implementation needs refinement. More data is needed. More analysis. More meditation. More time.
