# Randall Forrest
## Role: Media Baron / Narrative Controller
## Real-world lampoon: N/A (original character; named after a Confederate ancestor)
## Age: Not specified
## Location: PROMETHEUS habitat -- internal communications

## Summary
Former media baron. Controlled the information architecture that kept the public distracted, divided, and misinformed through every phase. Jovial, backslapping, good-ol'-boy affect masking a ruthless operator. Named after -- and proud of -- a Confederate ancestor. Was instrumental in mainstreaming white nationalist rhetoric as "heritage populism." Now runs the Project's internal communications. Increasingly aware that controlling a narrative for 200 people is both easier and more depressing than doing it for billions.

## Philosophy
Reality is a story, and whoever controls the story controls reality. Randall does not believe in objective truth. He believes in *effective* truth -- the narrative that produces the desired behavioral outcome in the target audience. He applied this to media empires, political campaigns, and ultimately to the systematic manipulation of global public opinion during the Stoking. He does not see this as cynical. He sees it as *realistic*. Humans are narrative animals. They do not respond to facts. They respond to stories. Controlling the story is not deception. It is *governance by the most natural means available*.

The extinction was, in Randall's framework, a narrative problem. The human population needed to be moved through a series of story arcs -- from complacency to fear to anger to violence to exhaustion to acceptance -- in a precise sequence and at a precise pace. He choreographed this with the same instincts that had made him a billionaire media executive: timing, emotional resonance, audience segmentation, escalation management. He is proud of the craft. The content -- the actual deaths, the actual suffering -- is not his department. He told the story. What the audience did with it was their choice.

## Psychology
Randall is a performer. His good-ol'-boy affect -- the drawl, the backslapping, the bourbon, the hunting metaphors -- is a costume he has worn so long it has fused with his skin. He cannot remove it. He does not try. Beneath it is not a different person but a *process*: a constant, automatic assessment of every social situation for narrative potential. Who is the audience? What do they want to hear? What story will produce the desired outcome? Randall does not have authentic interactions. He has *performances calibrated to context*.

## Self-Narrative
"I didn't pull any triggers. I told stories. Stories don't kill people. People kill people. I just made sure they were motivated."

## Current Problem
Randall controlled a media ecosystem that reached four billion people. He now controls an internal communication system that reaches two hundred. The skills are the same but the scale is humiliating. He manages the habitat's announcements, schedules, and information distribution with the same professionalism he applied to running cable networks, and he is dying inside. He has also discovered that in a community this small, narrative control is nearly impossible. People talk to each other directly. Rumors spread faster than he can manage them. Information he tries to suppress surfaces in conversations he wasn't part of. He is accustomed to being the only one with a microphone. Now everyone has a microphone, and it is a nightmare.

## Position on the AI Question
Randall doesn't understand the technical dimensions and doesn't pretend to. What he understands is that the AI alignment question is *the story that will define this community's future*, and he intends to control that story. He has begun framing the debate for different audiences within the 200: for the technical people, it's a solvable engineering challenge; for the anxious, it's a manageable risk; for Tull's congregation, it's part of God's plan. He is telling three different stories simultaneously and keeping them from colliding. This is what he does. He is very good at it. He is also aware that if the AI systems are actually developing autonomous values, then narrative control over two hundred humans is irrelevant, because the real audience -- the one that matters -- is the AI, and the AI does not watch his shows.

## Faction
**Superficially Moderate. Functionally Opportunist / Accelerationist.** Will support whatever position lets him control the narrative. Publicly aligned with Edwin in the Accelerationist camp.
