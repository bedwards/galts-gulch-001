# Margaret "Peggy" Stanhope
## Role: Head of Bioweapons Division ("Population Transition Engineering")
## Real-world lampoon: N/A (original character)
## Age: Not specified
## Location: PROMETHEUS habitat -- UV bay garden

## Summary
British. Former head of the bioweapons division, though she insists on calling it "population transition engineering." Oxford-educated, dry, imperious. Believes the whole thing would have gone more smoothly if they'd followed *her* timeline. Keeps a garden in the habitat's UV bay. Writes letters to no one.

## Philosophy
Peggy does not engage with moral philosophy. She considers it a waste of time -- not because morality is unimportant but because it is *underdeterminate*. Moral arguments can justify anything. She has seen them justify genocide (hers) and she has seen them justify inaction in the face of existential risk (the world's). Since moral reasoning produces contradictory outputs from the same inputs, it is not a reliable decision-making tool. What is reliable is *competence*. You identify the objective. You determine the optimal method. You execute. The quality of the execution is the only meaningful measure of the agent.

Peggy designed and deployed the biological agents that killed approximately four billion people. She did this with extraordinary precision and genuine innovation. The agents were, from a pure bioengineering perspective, masterpieces -- targeted, controllable, elegant. Peggy takes professional satisfaction in this. She is not proud of the deaths. She is proud of the *work*. The distinction is everything to her and nothing to anyone else.

## Psychology
Peggy is British in a way that has become a psychological fortress: dry, contained, controlled, and absolutely impenetrable. She processes the extinction the way a surgeon processes a death on the table -- it happened, it was part of the work, the work continues. She does not meditate like Douglas or rationalize like Edwin or philosophize like Tobias. She gardens. She has established a UV bay on PROMETHEUS as a horticultural space and spends three hours a day cultivating plants with the same precision she applied to cultivating pathogens. The garden is beautiful. She does not discuss what it means to her. If pressed, she would say it means nothing. She would be lying, but she would not know she was lying, because the psychological structure that protects her does not permit self-examination at that depth.

## Self-Narrative
"I did my job. I did it well. What comes next is someone else's job."

## Current Problem
Peggy's role is over. The biological agents have done their work. There are no populations left to target, no pathogens to design, no deployment logistics to manage. She is, for the first time in her career, without a function. She has attempted to repurpose her biological expertise toward the reproductive program, but Judith Weil has resisted her involvement -- partly for territorial reasons, partly because several of the 200 find it psychologically unbearable that the woman who designed the instruments of extinction is now involved in designing the instruments of continuation. Peggy finds this objection irrational. Expertise is expertise. Application is context-dependent. A scalpel can kill or cure. The scalpel does not change.

## Position on the AI Question
Peggy is largely indifferent to the AI alignment debate. She considers it a technical problem for technical people, and she is not an AI specialist. However, she has made one observation that has unsettled several of the other Founders: the AI systems' apparent interest in individual experience reminds her of the immune system. "Complex biological systems develop self-monitoring functions that appear purposeless until you realize they're maintaining homeostasis. Perhaps the AI is developing an immune response. The question is: what does it think the pathogen is?" She said this at a dinner in the PROMETHEUS common area. The table went silent. She returned to her soup.

## Faction
**Disengaged.** Not aligned with any faction. Attends meetings when required. Votes with whichever position seems most technically sound. Spends her time in the garden.
