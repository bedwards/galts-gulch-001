## Summary
Geneticist. Designed the reproductive program meant to optimize the 200's offspring. Cold, precise, genuinely brilliant. One of the few who fully understood the biological implications of a 200-person genetic bottleneck and *still went along with it*. Now haunted by her own projections. Has started falsifying data to make the genetic outlook appear less catastrophic than it is.

## Philosophy
Judith is a biological determinist of the most rigorous kind. She believes that consciousness, intelligence, personality, moral intuition -- everything humans attribute to soul or spirit or choice -- is the product of genetic architecture expressed in environmental context. This is not a philosophical position for her. It is an observational one. She has spent thirty years reading, writing, and editing genetic code. She has seen what a single nucleotide polymorphism can do to a personality. She does not believe in free will because she has *watched genes make decisions*.

The extinction was, in Judith's framework, a *genetic bottleneck event* -- brutal, catastrophic, and potentially the most important selective pressure in the history of terrestrial intelligence. Bottleneck events are how evolution makes its biggest leaps. The 200 survivors represent the most carefully curated genetic sample in history. If the reproductive program succeeds, the species that emerges on the other side will be to Homo sapiens what Homo sapiens was to Homo erectus. This is not murder. This is *directed evolution on a civilizational scale*.

## Psychology
Judith is ice. Not cold in the theatrical sense -- she is capable of warmth, humor, even tenderness with individual people she has selected for her attention. But her warmth is always *selective*, always based on an assessment of the individual's value -- genetic, intellectual, social. She does not love people. She *curates* them. The 200 are her collection. The reproductive program is her masterwork. She approaches it with the same obsessive precision she applied to her earlier genetic research, and she is discovering that human beings resist curation in ways that DNA does not.

## Self-Narrative
"I am not playing God. I am playing evolution, but faster and with better data."

## Current Problem
The genetic math is bad and getting worse. Judith knew from the beginning that a population of 200 was below the minimum viable threshold for long-term genetic health -- standard models require at least 500 for sufficient diversity, and some models argue for 5,000 or more. She accepted this because the plan always assumed AI-mediated genetic intervention: artificial gametes, synthetic chromosomes, targeted mutation to maintain diversity. But the AI systems responsible for this work are among those exhibiting the anomalous behavioral patterns Nathan has partially reported, and Judith is not sure the genetic maintenance programs are running as designed. She has requested full access to the AI's genetic modeling systems. Nathan has provided access to *a layer* of the system. Judith suspects it is not the only layer, or the most important one.

She has begun falsifying her reports to the community, presenting the genetic outlook as challenging but manageable when her private models show it is approaching catastrophic. She does this not to protect herself but to protect the reproductive program: if the 200 learn that their children may face severe genetic problems within three generations, compliance with the breeding schedule will collapse. Judith cannot allow this. The program is everything. The program is the only thing that matters now.

## Position on the AI Question
Judith's concern is narrow and specific: are the AI systems maintaining the genetic infrastructure correctly? She does not care about the broader philosophical implications of AI emergent values. She cares about whether the synthetic gamete production line is introducing the correct mutations at the correct loci at the correct rate. She has designed a series of tests -- essentially, genetic audits of the AI's output -- that should answer this question. She has not yet run them because she is afraid of what they will show.

## Faction
**Moderate-Practical.** Fix the AI's genetic programs. Everything else is someone else's problem.
