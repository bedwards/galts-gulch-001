# Colonel William "Buck" Patterson
## Role: Head of Military Operations / Security Enforcement
## Real-world lampoon: N/A (original character)
## Age: Not specified
## Location: PROMETHEUS habitat -- security patrols and personal armory

## Summary
Head of the military operations that executed the physical phases. Career special forces, then private military, then the Project's enforcement arm. Doesn't philosophize. Did what he was told because he believed the people telling him were smarter than he was. Now the most heavily armed person in the habitat and slowly realizing that the geniuses don't actually have a plan for what comes next. Drinks synthetic bourbon alone.

## Philosophy
Buck does not have a philosophy. He has a *code*, which is different. The code is simple: identify the legitimate authority. Follow its orders. Execute with maximum competence and minimum waste. Protect the people you are responsible for. Do not ask questions above your pay grade.

Buck followed this code through twenty years of special operations, eight years of private military work, and the entirety of the Project. He killed people on five continents because the people he had identified as the legitimate authority told him to. He did not enjoy it. He did not agonize over it. He *performed* it, the way a surgeon performs an operation: with focus, skill, and emotional detachment that is maintained by the absolute conviction that someone smarter than you has determined that this is necessary.

## Psychology
Buck is not stupid. This must be understood clearly. He is not a mindless grunt. He has a 131 IQ, speaks three languages, and can disassemble and analyze a geopolitical situation with genuine sophistication. His obedience is not a product of limited intelligence. It is a product of *chosen limitation* -- a deliberate decision, made decades ago, to circumscribe the domain of his moral responsibility. He is responsible for the *how*. Someone else is responsible for the *why*. This arrangement has served him his entire career. It is now failing.

## Self-Narrative
"I'm a soldier. Soldiers follow orders. The brass makes the calls. That's how it works."

## Current Problem
The brass is thirteen civilians who can't agree on anything, the orders have stopped making sense, and the enemy -- if there is one -- might be the AI systems that Buck cannot fight with any weapon he possesses. Buck is the most heavily armed person in the habitat. He maintains a personal armory that could suppress a small insurgency. He runs security drills. He patrols corridors. He is performing the rituals of a soldier in an environment where soldiering is meaningless, and the performance is becoming increasingly desperate as he realizes that the only battles left are ones he is not equipped to fight.

He has begun drinking synthetic bourbon in quantities that Judith has flagged in her medical reports. He reads his private file on every member of the 200 every night before he sleeps -- threat assessments, psychological profiles, contingency plans for every individual. He updates the files regularly. He does not know what he is preparing for. He prepares anyway, because preparation is the only response his code permits.

## Position on the AI Question
Buck is straightforward: if the AI is a threat, he wants rules of engagement. He wants a clear definition of what constitutes a hostile act, a chain of command for the response, and authorization to use whatever force is necessary. The fact that no one can give him these things -- because the "threat" is not hostile action but *opaque philosophical development* -- is genuinely unbearable for him. He has asked Nathan seven times for a "plain English" explanation of the AI alignment problem. Nathan has provided seven explanations, each more technical than the last, and Buck understands none of them. He has started asking Kat instead, and Kat's explanations are making him more afraid, not less, because Kat is honest.

## Faction
**Extreme-Interventionist.** If we can't verify the AI is aligned, shut it down. If we can't shut it down, destroy it. If we can't destroy it, die trying. This is the only clear order Buck can give himself, and he is clinging to it.
