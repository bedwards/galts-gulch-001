description: Review all cards and look for new connections, reorderings
---

1. Read all cards with status draft-1 or higher
2. Read structure/outline.md and structure/mirror-map.md
3. Suggest:
   - Cards that create unexpected resonance when adjacent
   - Seeds that could be planted earlier or detonated later
   - Structural mirrors between first-half and second-half
   - Cards that belong in different chapters
   - Fragments that are ready to become scenes
4. Present suggestions. Do not modify files without approval.
