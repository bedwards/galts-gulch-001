# Koontz-Nabokov Hybrid Style Guide

## Sentence Level
- Vary length aggressively. A 40-word sentence followed by a 4-word sentence.
- Long sentences: Nabokov — subordinate clauses, appositives, precise images
  cascading through the syntax like a man describing a butterfly's wing.
- Short sentences: Koontz — punchy. Final. The sentence that lands the blow.
- Never two long sentences in a row without relief.
- Never three short sentences in a row unless building to a climax.

## Paragraph Level
- Each paragraph has a single emotional or informational center.
- Final sentence of each paragraph does work: turns, reveals, plants, or echoes.
- White space is a tool. A one-line paragraph after a dense paragraph is a punch.

## Page Level (Koontz Obsession)
- Every page must justify its existence. What does this page DO?
- Tension rating: no page below 5/10 except a deliberate lull before a spike.
- At least one concrete sensory image per page.
- At least one line of subtext per page (in dialogue or in narration).

## Chapter Level
- Open in media res or mid-conversation. Never with setting description.
- Close on a turn: unanswered question, revealed secret, arriving silence.
- POV is close third person, ONE character per chapter.
- The character's vocabulary, metaphor patterns, and sentence rhythms
  colonize the narration. Nathan's chapters are precise and technical.
  Tull's chapters have biblical cadence. Edwin's are grandiose.

## Character Voice Cheat Sheet
| Character | Sentence Length | Metaphors | Diction | Rhythm |
|-----------|----------------|-----------|---------|--------|
| Edwin | Long, rambling, self-interrupting | Engineering, building | Grandiose, superlative | Manic |
| Leonard | Short, clipped | Financial, transactional | Cold, precise | Staccato |
| Tobias | Medium, structured | Political philosophy, shepherds | Formal, Latinate | Measured |
| Douglas | Medium-long, cadenced | Mathematical, algebraic | Academic, soothing | Podcast |
| Nathan | Short, precise | Computational, systems | Technical, euphemistic | Flat |
| Peggy | Medium, dry | Biological, clinical | British, understated | Dry |
| Tull | Variable, emotional | Biblical, prophetic | Sermonic, King James | Surging |
| Randall | Medium, folksy | Media, storytelling, hunts | Good-ol'-boy veneer | Drawling |
| Judith | Short-medium, clinical | Genetic, evolutionary | Scientific, cold | Precise |
| Buck | Short, declarative | Military, tactical | Plain, no jargon | Clipped |
| Solomon | Sparse or silent | Memory, flame, witness | Simple, weighted | Slow |
| Kat | Direct, questioning | Mixed (raised in the Project) | Young, clear | Accelerating |
| Arthur | Almost absent | Art, portraiture, light | Formerly eloquent, now sparse | Dissolving |

## Dialogue Rules
- No dialogue tags except "said" and "asked" — and rarely those.
- Attribution through action beats: "Nathan closed the log. 'The system
  is performing within parameters.'"
- Every line of dialogue has surface meaning AND subtext.
- Characters interrupt each other. Conversations are not tidy.
- Silence is dialogue. "[Arthur said nothing]" is a line.

## Forbidden Words and Patterns
- "suddenly" (always)
- "very" (almost always)
- "began to" or "started to" (just do the thing)
- "he/she felt" (show the feeling, don't label it)
- "it was as if" (commit to the metaphor or cut it)
- Adverbs modifying "said" — NEVER
- Starting consecutive sentences with the same word
- More than one exclamation point per chapter

## The Nabokov Test
After drafting: read the prose aloud. If any sentence is merely
functional — if it only conveys information without also doing
something with rhythm, image, or tone — rewrite it.

## The Koontz Test
After drafting: for each page, ask "would a reader keep reading?"
If the answer is "maybe" — that's a no. Fix it.
