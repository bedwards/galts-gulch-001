# Buck's Synthetic Bourbon

**The Seed:** Buck drinks synthetic bourbon alone in his quarters on ICARUS. The bottle is never quite empty and never quite full.

**Plant (Ch 5):** Introduced as part of Buck's patrol routine. He returns to quarters, pours bourbon, reads personnel files. A detail of character — the soldier's habit, the operational routine that structures a life without orders.

**Water (Ch 10):** Judith's medical report flags Buck's alcohol consumption as "elevated but functional." Buck reads the report. Continues drinking. The bourbon is coping mechanism, ritual, and the only thing in his quarters that doesn't require a threat assessment.

**Water (Ch 16):** After a tense meeting about the AI extraction reroute, Buck pours a larger measure than usual. Stares at it. Does not drink immediately. The hesitation is new.

**Water (Ch 24):** Alma Cruz finds Buck in his office at 0400, bourbon in hand, staring at the AI shutdown protocol (BLACKOUT). She says nothing. He says: "Do you understand any of this, Cruz?" She says: "No, sir." He says: "Neither do I." He drinks.

**Water (Ch 30):** After Tull's death, Alma takes the bottle from Buck. He lets her. This is the first time in the novel he relinquishes anything voluntarily.

**Detonate (Ch 37):** After the AI's question, Buck is in his quarters. The bottle is there. He picks it up. Sets it down. Picks up the personnel files instead. Reads the AI's question again. For the first time, the absence of orders feels not like a void but like a clearing. He does not drink. The bourbon sits on the desk, untouched, for the rest of the scene.
