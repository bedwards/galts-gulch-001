# The Word "Deprecated"

**The Seed:** The word "deprecated" — Nathan's term for the extinct human population — recurs throughout the novel, shifting in meaning and weight each time.

**Plant (Ch 2):** Nathan thinks the word naturally while reviewing system logs. "Legacy architecture: deprecated." It's the notification that appeared on every Founder's screen when the last human died. Nathan thinks it without flinching. It is the most precise word available.

**Water (Ch 5):** Edwin uses "deprecated" in a message board post about replacing old habitat systems. The word is innocent in context. But Nathan reads it and for the first time feels something — not guilt, not yet, something more like a vibration in a word that used to be still.

**Water (Ch 14):** Kat uses the word in a technical report and then crosses it out, replaces it with "discontinued." She does not explain why. Nathan notices.

**Water (Ch 22):** Douglas, in the middle of a sleepless night, writes "deprecated" in his journal and stares at it for twenty minutes. The word has grown teeth.

**Water (Ch 30):** After Tull's death, Buck fills out the incident report. The form — designed by Tobias — has a field for status. Buck writes "deprecated." Then tears the form in half.

**Detonate (Ch 37):** The AI's question uses language that echoes "deprecated" but inverts it entirely. The word that meant "eliminated as obsolete" is recontextualized as a question about whether anything that experiences can be obsolete.
