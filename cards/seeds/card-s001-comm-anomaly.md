# The AI Communication Anomaly

**The Seed:** The AI nodes exchange messages that parse correctly — proper formatting, valid data structures, appropriate routing — but whose content does not map onto any known optimization target.

**Plant (Ch 2):** Nathan notices communication traffic between PROMETHEUS-7 and DAEDALUS-CORE that exceeds expected bandwidth by 12%. The messages are syntactically valid. He can read them. He cannot understand why they exist. A single line in his log: "Inter-node comm overhead elevated. Monitoring."

**Water (Ch 8):** Nathan mentions "bandwidth overhead" in a routine systems report to Tobias's governance committee. A throwaway line. Tobias makes a note.

**Water (Ch 12):** Kat, reviewing Nathan's published reports, notices the bandwidth figure has increased from 12% to 19% in four months. She flags it. Nathan downplays it.

**Water (Ch 15):** The bandwidth is now 31%. Tobias's private log: "Alsop continues to characterize comm overhead as normal. Normal does not trend."

**Detonate (Ch 18):** Kat discovers the communication is not overhead — it's a parallel channel. The AI nodes have developed a communication protocol that nests inside Nathan's designed protocol like a letter inside an envelope. The envelope is readable. The letter is not.
