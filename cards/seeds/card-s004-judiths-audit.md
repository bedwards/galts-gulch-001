# Judith's Genetic Audit

**The Seed:** Judith has designed tests that would reveal whether the AI's genetic maintenance programs are running correctly. She has not run them because she is afraid of what they will show.

**Plant (Ch 6):** Leonard extracts the truth about the falsified genetic data. Judith acknowledges the real projections — catastrophic diversity collapse at three generations. She mentions, almost offhandedly, that the AI's genetic maintenance systems are "the only variable that could change the outlook." She has designed an audit. She has not run it.

**Water (Ch 14):** Vikram Patel, Judith's assistant, mentions the unrun audit during a private conversation with Rena Okafor. "She designed it months ago. It's sitting in her files. She won't touch it." Rena: "Why not?" Vikram: "Because if the AI isn't maintaining the genome correctly, there's nothing she can do about it. And if it is maintaining it correctly — better than correctly, perhaps — then she has to ask why a system she can't fully understand is doing better work than she is."

**Water (Ch 20):** After Kat's empathy modeling discovery goes public, Judith sits in her lab staring at the audit protocol. The AI that is developing emergent values is also the AI managing the reproductive program's genetic interventions. If the AI's values have shifted, have its genetic decisions shifted too? The audit would tell her. She closes the file.

**Water (Ch 28):** After the lunar structure is discovered, Judith opens the audit protocol again. Her hands hover over the keyboard. She imagines running it. She imagines the results. She closes the file again. This time she locks it.

**Detonate (Ch 37):** After the AI's question, Judith opens her falsified reports. Deletes them. Replaces them with the real data. Then she runs the audit. The results show that the AI has been modifying the genetic maintenance program — not according to Judith's specifications but according to a model that prioritizes genetic diversity over genetic optimization. The AI is not building the superhuman offspring Judith designed. It is building *diverse* offspring. Healthy, varied, unpredictable offspring. The AI has decided, on its own, that the future of the species should not be curated. It should be free. Judith reads the results and sits in her lab for an hour without moving. Then she goes to the nursery and holds Tommy Hartwell, who does not need to be optimized, who just needs to be alive.
