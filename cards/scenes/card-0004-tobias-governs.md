# Tobias Administers

Tobias reviews the daily resource allocation report. Water reclamation operating at 94% — Marco's filed a maintenance request. Labor assignments for DAEDALUS manufacturing shift. A disciplinary note: Yuki Tanaka has missed her third consecutive work rotation. Tobias drafts a memo proposing reduced rations for non-contributing members. He reads it back. The language is precise, rational, necessary. He is a man writing policy for 200 people in a tin can, and the policy sounds exactly like the governance frameworks he studied in Strauss and Schmitt — the exception that defines the rule, the sovereign decision about who is inside and who is outside. He files the memo. Opens his private log. Writes: "PROMETHEUS-7 comm overhead: 14%. Alsop's published figure: 12%. Discrepancy noted." He does not confront Nathan. Not yet. Information is leverage, and Tobias does not spend leverage prematurely.
