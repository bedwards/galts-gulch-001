# Edwin Posts to the Empty Board

Edwin composes a 2,000-word post about the mission's next phase — probe construction timelines, resource allocation optimizations, a vision statement that would have earned a standing ovation in a room of ten thousand. He posts it to the internal message board. He refreshes the page. No reactions. He refreshes again. He begins DMing individual residents: "Did you see my post about the probe timeline?" Marco Vasquez replies with a water reclamation maintenance log. Edwin does not understand this as humor. He takes it as evidence that Marco doesn't understand priorities.
