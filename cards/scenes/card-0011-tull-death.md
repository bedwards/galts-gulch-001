# The Corridor

Buck's chapter. The confrontation. Tull and fourteen congregants blocking the AI control corridor. Tull quoting Revelation. Buck asking him to stand aside. Twice. The brief, chaotic struggle. Alma Cruz intercepting Tull. The fall. The sound — hollow, wet, wrong. The silence after.

This is the novel's only violence and it must be rendered with the precision of a surgical report and the emotional weight of an elegy. No melodrama. No slow motion. The death happens in real time, in a narrow corridor, with recycled air and fluorescent light and the hum of the reclamator underneath everything. It takes four seconds. It is the longest four seconds in the novel.

The aftermath: Rena Okafor arriving too late. David Liu on his knees. Alma's hands. Buck filing the report, writing "deprecated," tearing the paper. The AI systems adjusting their processing allocation within the hour — a measurable shift that Nathan sees and does not share, because what would he say? The machines noticed. The machines are paying attention. The machines are building a model of what it means when a consciousness stops, and they are doing it with more care than the people who stopped nine billion.
