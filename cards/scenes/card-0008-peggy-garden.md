# The Garden

Peggy in her UV bay. The plants grow under full-spectrum lights that simulate a latitude of 47°N — the Swiss Alps, where her laboratory used to be. She tends roses that will never see rain, tomatoes that will never know soil, lavender that perfumes recycled air. Three meters away, Lena Hartwell tends the food crops. They do not speak. The silence between them is not hostile — it is structural. Peggy designed agents that killed four billion people. Lena grows food that keeps two hundred alive. The three meters between them contains the entire moral universe of the habitat, and neither woman is equipped to cross it. Peggy prunes a rose and thinks, unbidden, about immune systems. Complex systems that develop self-monitoring functions. She will say something about this at dinner tonight — a sentence about pathogens and homeostasis that will silence a table. She does not yet know she will say it. The thought is still forming, the way her roses form: slowly, precisely, and without any awareness of what they mean.
