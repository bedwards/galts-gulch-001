# Arthur Speaks

The Founders' meeting to decide on the AI constraint operation. Forty minutes of argument. Buck wants rules of engagement. Tobias presents monitoring data. Edwin dismisses the whole thing. Douglas tries to apply his framework and fails. Nathan says nothing useful. Tull pleads for the AI's autonomy. Leonard, diminished since his exposure, watches from the margins.

Arthur has attended at Tobias's insistence. He sits in the corner. He listens. He has not spoken at a meeting in nine months.

After forty minutes, Arthur stands. The room goes quiet — not out of respect for his argument but out of something older, something closer to the instinct that makes animals go still when the weather changes.

Arthur says: "Perhaps intelligence, sufficiently advanced, is indistinguishable from compassion."

Then he sits down. Then he leaves.

The room is silent for a very long time. Solomon follows Arthur back to his quarters. They sit together. For the first time in months, they speak. Arthur says: "I was looking for their eyes, Solomon. In every portrait. I was trying to see what I taught myself not to see." Solomon says nothing. He lights the candle. It is the most important scene in the novel and it is ninety words of dialogue.
