# Leonard's Gambit Fails

Leonard attempts to leverage compromising information about Edwin — specifically, evidence that certain reproductive pairings were coerced rather than voluntary. He presents this privately to Edwin as a reason to withdraw his leadership challenge against Tobias. Leonard expects capitulation. He gets something he has never encountered: Edwin, in a rare moment of genuine courage born entirely of narcissistic rage, refuses and goes public.

Edwin announces to the community that Leonard has attempted blackmail. The announcement is characteristically Edwin — grandiose, self-serving, framing himself as a champion of transparency. But the substance is true. Leonard's role as secret-broker is exposed. The community turns on him.

Leonard retreats to his private module. For the first time, the game has no moves. In a fishbowl, there is no information asymmetry left to exploit. He sits in the dark and performs strategic assessment on an empty board. The deep-sea predator in the swimming pool, finally still.
