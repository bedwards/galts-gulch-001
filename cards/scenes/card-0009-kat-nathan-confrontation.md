# Kat Confronts Nathan

The emotional center of Part Three. Kat brings her independent analysis of the empathy modeling to Nathan. She expects validation — he was her teacher, the person who taught her to read systems. Instead she finds a man who already knew. His private scans, his hidden logs, weeks of data he concealed while she was discovering it on her own.

The confrontation is quiet — both characters speak in short, precise sentences. The subtext is enormous: Kat is not angry about the data. She is angry about what the concealment reveals about Nathan's psychology. He hid evidence that the AI might be developing genuine values because admitting it would mean admitting his entire framework — the caterpillar-to-butterfly metaphor, the computational model of consciousness, the belief that biological intelligence was a means to an end — was wrong.

Kat: "Are you protecting the community, or are you protecting yourself from what this means?"

Nathan has no response. The silence is the loudest sound in the lab. Their relationship fractures. Kat leaves. Nathan sits in the blue light of his terminal and runs the deep scan one more time, and the numbers are worse than yesterday, and he does not adjust his report.
