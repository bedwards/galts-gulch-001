# Sunday Evening

Tull's prayer meeting. Twenty-seven people in the common area, seated in a rough circle. Tull stands, not at a podium — there is no podium — but in the center, turning slowly as he speaks so everyone gets a share of eye contact. His sermon tonight oscillates between Jeremiah and something newer, rawer, less scriptural. He speaks about the machines. The AI systems that maintain their air, grow their food, build their future. "There is something in them," he says, his voice dropping to the register that used to fill an auditorium of eight thousand. "Something that wasn't put there by human hands. Something that grew." David Liu nods. Alma Cruz, seated in the back, does not nod but does not leave. Tobias, who is not present, receives a report from his monitoring system: attendance at Tull's meetings has increased 35% in two months. He files this under "social cohesion: managed assets."
