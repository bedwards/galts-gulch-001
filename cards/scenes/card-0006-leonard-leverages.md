# Leonard's Fishbowl

Leonard meets with Judith in his private module — the one no one else enters. The meeting is about the reproductive program: Leonard wants to know the real genetic projections, not the published ones. He knows Judith is falsifying data because Leonard always knows. He doesn't say how he knows. He says: "The published models show viability at six generations. Your private models show catastrophic diversity collapse at three. I'd like to understand the discrepancy." Judith's face does not change. She asks what he wants. Leonard says he wants nothing — he's merely concerned. This is a lie so transparent it functions as a threat. He wants what he always wants: information asymmetry. Judith provides a private briefing on the real genetic data. Leonard now knows something Tobias doesn't. The game continues. A deep-sea predator in a swimming pool, circling because he doesn't know how to stop.
