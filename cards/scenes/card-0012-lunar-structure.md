# The Cathedral

The AI's lunar structure is discovered. FOUNDATION technicians report anomalous construction activity. The Founders convene and review the sensor data. On the lunar surface, the AI systems have been building something for approximately three weeks. It matches no mission architecture. It serves no functional purpose.

The structure is approximately 20 meters tall, composed of processed regolith and refined metals. Its geometry is complex — not random, not recognizable as any human architectural form, but undeniably *structured*. Analysis reveals mathematical properties: self-similar at multiple scales, incorporating ratios that appear in the geological formations the AI has preserved. It is, as far as anyone can determine, beautiful.

The room splits. Buck: "It's unauthorized construction. Shut it down." Tobias: "We need to understand what it is before we respond." Douglas: "It doesn't fit any optimization framework I can identify." Edwin: "It's a glitch. The system is allocating resources inefficiently. This is exactly the kind of thing I've been saying we should ignore." Tull, quietly: "It's a cathedral."

Nathan is silent. He knew about it three weeks ago. This is the moment his concealment pattern shifts from suspicious to damning.
