# The Ethics Seminar (Attendance: Six)

Douglas holds his weekly ethical reflection session. He has prepared a forty-minute presentation on "Post-Transition Value Alignment: A Framework for Communal Flourishing." Seventeen people attended the first session. Then twelve. Then nine. Today: six, one of whom is asleep. Rena Okafor attends out of professional obligation — she's tracking Douglas for signs of decompensation. The session devolves into an argument about sleeping quarter allocation. Douglas tries to resolve it with expected-value calculations. Mid-sentence, an intrusive image: a crowd of faces, sunlit, on a street he has never visited. He pauses. Recovers. No one notices except Rena, who writes something in her notebook.
