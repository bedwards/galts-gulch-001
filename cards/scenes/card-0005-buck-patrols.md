# Buck Patrols

Buck walks the corridors of ICARUS at 0200. Flashlight unnecessary — the emergency lighting is always on — but he carries one anyway. Old habit. The armory is secure. The observation deck is empty. Module 7 — Yuki Tanaka's — has a light on. He notes this. Through the transparent section of the corridor, Earth hangs in the viewport: blue, white, green, silent. It looks the same. That's the thing no one talks about. From up here, you can't tell everyone's dead. Buck returns to his quarters. Pours synthetic bourbon. Opens the personnel files on his tablet. Two hundred profiles. Threat assessments he updates weekly. He does not know what he's preparing for. He reads Alma Cruz's file. Loyal. Competent. Recent behavioral note: attending social gatherings in PROMETHEUS common area, Sunday evenings. He does not yet know these are Tull's prayer meetings. He will.
