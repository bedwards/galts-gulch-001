# Earth from the Observation Deck

The planet looks the same. This is the thing no one talks about. From 400 kilometers up, you cannot tell that every city is dark, every highway empty, every field untended. The clouds still form. The oceans still catch sunlight. The green belt of the Amazon — thinned by decades of deforestation but recovering now, recovering faster than anyone modeled, because the thing that was destroying it is gone — still spreads across the continent like a held breath.

Earth does not mourn. Earth does not accuse. Earth simply continues, the way it continued through five mass extinctions before this one, each time shrugging off the dominant species and growing something new from the wreckage.

This indifference is the cruelest thing the Founders face. They expected the planet to reflect their crime. They expected desolation — scorched earth, dead oceans, a world that looked as destroyed as they knew it to be. Instead: beauty. Unconscionable, unanswerable beauty. A planet that is, by every environmental metric, *healthier* without the species that loved it.

The observation deck on ICARUS faces this beauty head-on, and that is why most of the 200 avoid it, and why the ones who don't avoid it come back again and again, and why the chairs in the front row — closest to the glass, closest to the planet — are slightly more worn than the others.
