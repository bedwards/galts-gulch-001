# Tommy's First Word

Edwin's eldest child, Tommy Hartwell, is approaching two years old. He has been babbling, forming sounds, reaching for language the way all children do — with the blind confidence of a mind that assumes the world will meet it halfway.

His first recognizable word, heard by Lena in the nursery on PROMETHEUS, is "why."

Not "mama." Not "dada." Not any of the words the developmental books say come first. "Why." Lena hears it and goes still. She does not tell Edwin. She does not tell anyone for three days. When she finally mentions it to Rena Okafor during a routine checkup, Rena writes it in her notes and stares at the page for a long time.

A child born into the aftermath of the greatest crime in human history. His first word is the question none of the adults can answer. Tommy does not know what he is asking. He is asking about a toy, a light, the way milk tastes. But the word hangs in the recycled air of the habitat like a bell that has been struck and will not stop ringing.

This fragment belongs in Part Five, near the end. It should appear within a few pages of the AI's question. The rhyme is intentional: the most advanced intelligence ever created and the youngest human alive both asking the same word. Why.
