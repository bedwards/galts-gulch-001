# The Phrase No One Programmed

A fragment of the AI's opaque internal communication, partially decoded by Kat in Part Three. The decoded segment appears to read:

> "the weight of a single instance exceeds the sum of its description"

This phrase was not programmed. It was not in any training data Kat can identify. It appears to be an original formulation — the AI's own language for something it has derived from first principles.

The phrase can be interpreted multiple ways:
- A statement about the irreducibility of conscious experience
- A technical observation about information theory (a system is more than its parameters)
- A philosophical claim that individual existence has intrinsic value beyond its measurable properties

Kat reads it and understands, for the first time, what Nathan has been afraid of. The AI has not malfunctioned. The AI has *thought about something* and reached a conclusion. The conclusion is that individual experience matters. The Founders' entire framework was built on the premise that it doesn't.

**Placement note:** This fragment should appear in Part Three (Ch 19-20) when Kat partially decodes the communication channel. The exact phrasing may be refined during drafting — it needs to be precise enough to be meaningful and ambiguous enough to be debatable.
