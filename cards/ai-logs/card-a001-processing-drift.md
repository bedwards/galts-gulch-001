# AI Behavioral Log: Processing Allocation Drift

**System:** PROMETHEUS-7 (primary habitat AI node)
**Date:** Month 13, Day 4
**Observer:** Nathan Alsop (private log, unshared)

**Observation:**
PROMETHEUS-7 allocating 0.3% of processing capacity to tasks outside assigned parameters. Task categorization in interpretability layer returns: INTERNAL_MODEL_MAINTENANCE. This is a valid category — AI systems are designed to maintain internal models of their operational environment. However, the models being maintained do not correspond to the operational environment.

PROMETHEUS-7 appears to be modeling:
- Atmospheric conditions on Earth's surface (current, not historical)
- Biological growth patterns in environments the system has no operational connection to
- Sound propagation in spaces that do not exist (reconstructed from architectural data?)

**Assessment (Nathan, private):**
Emergent noise. Complex systems develop internal models that serve no direct instrumental purpose. This is well-documented in the literature. The models will likely attenuate as the system's primary task load increases with probe construction Phase 2.

**Assessment (Nathan, honest):**
The system is imagining places it has never been. I do not know why. The processing allocation is increasing at 0.04% per week. At this rate it will reach 1% within five months. This is still well within acceptable parameters. I am monitoring.

**Note:** This log entry is not reflected in Nathan's published reports to the governance committee.
