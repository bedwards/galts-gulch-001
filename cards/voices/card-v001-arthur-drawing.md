# Arthur and the Baker from Marseille

Arthur's interiority as he draws. The charcoal on synthetic paper. The face of a woman he has never met — the baker from Marseille, reconstructed from three seconds of news footage archived in the habitat's cultural database. He has drawn her before. Three times this week. Always from the same angle, always with flour on her hands. He cannot get the eyes right. The eyes hold something his hand cannot reproduce and his mind, after thirty years of thinking in aggregates and cosmic timescales, cannot identify. It is specific. It is hers alone. It is the thing he spent his career arguing was subordinate to the mission. Iris enters, collects yesterday's portraits, numbers them, files them. They do not speak. The charcoal scratches. The silence holds.
