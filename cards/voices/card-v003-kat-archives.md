# Kat Watches the World

Kat's fourteen-hour vigil at the cultural archive terminal. The footage plays without commentary. Bangkok: a market vendor arranging mangoes in a pyramid, laughing at something someone off-screen has said. Manchester: children chasing each other across wet pavement, their coats too big. Oaxaca: a wedding party spilling out of a church, confetti caught in someone's hair. Seoul: a grandmother's hands, spotted and sure, folding dumplings while a child watches with the absolute concentration of someone learning something that matters.

Kat was raised inside the Project. She learned that humanity was a coordination problem. A legacy architecture. A means to an end. She had never seen it as *this*. She does not cry. She sits very still and watches the dead live, and something in the architecture of her certainty shifts — not collapses, not yet, but shifts, the way a building shifts before it settles or before it falls, and she cannot tell which.
