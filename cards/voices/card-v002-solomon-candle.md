# Solomon Lights the Candle

Solomon's ritual. The yahrzeit candle — synthesized paraffin, cotton wick, housed in a glass container he fabricated in the workshop. It is not a proper yahrzeit candle. Nothing here is proper. He lights it at sunset, which is a fiction — there is no sunset in orbit, just a timer that dims the corridor lights on a twenty-four-hour cycle. He lights it for no one in particular, he has said. He lights it for everyone. The flame leans in the recycled air, reaching for something that is not there. Solomon opens his file — entry 847 of his history of the dead — and begins to write about a child in Quito who was afraid of dogs and loved the color yellow. He does not know this child's name. The database has only a photograph: a school portrait, gap-toothed, a yellow collar on a blue shirt. He writes what he can see. It is not enough. It is all he has.
