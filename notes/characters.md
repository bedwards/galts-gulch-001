# Character Profiles for *Galt's Gulch*

Satirical premise — it's a dark, pointed critique of longtermist/effective accelerationist ideology taken to its monstrous logical endpoint. Think *Dr. Strangelove* meets *Lord of the Flies*.

Here are 13 named characters among the 200 survivors, now adrift on orbital habitats and lunar installations they simply call "the Project."

---

**1. Edwin Hartwell** *(the Musk lampoon)*
Former CEO of multiple vertically integrated companies spanning rockets, electric vehicles, neural interfaces, and social media. Erratic, manic, desperately needs an audience — which is now a problem since there are only 199 other people. Posts compulsively to an internal message board no one reads. Convinced he's the indispensable man but can't fix a water reclamator without calling someone else. Claims credit for everything. Has fathered 11 children with 4 of the 200, already causing resource allocation disputes.

**2. Leonard Grafton** *(the Epstein lampoon)*
The financial architect. Ran the shadow funding networks that bankrolled every layer of the plan. Nobody can fully explain what Leonard *does*, but everyone's project depended on his money. Kept meticulous records of every compromising thing every other member ever did — "insurance," he calls it. Even now, with civilization gone, he leverages secrets. Several of the 200 quietly wish he'd been left behind. Has a private module no one else is allowed to enter. The youngest women in the group avoid him, and everyone pretends not to notice.

**3. Tobias Raeburn** *(the Karp/Thiel hybrid)*
The surveillance and defense architect. Built the AI systems that identified, tracked, and ultimately neutralized resistors at every phase. Speaks in calm, philosophical cadences about "necessary clarity." Gay, conservative, deeply read in Strauss and Schmitt, believes in the natural aristocracy of the intelligent. Sees himself as the only honest one — he'll say out loud what the others euphemize. Runs the Project's internal security apparatus and decides who gets access to what. The closest thing they have to a secret police chief, which he finds "regrettable but structurally inevitable."

**4. Douglas Kemper** *(the Sam Harris lampoon)*
The Project's ethicist-in-residence. Provided the rational framework that made the whole thing feel *reasonable*. Published extensively before the end, making calm, measured arguments about "the algebra of suffering" and why nine billion deaths could be morally justified under expected utility calculations. Meditates two hours a day. Speaks in a soothing podcast cadence even during arguments about sewage management. Keeps saying "I've been very clear about this" when no one agrees with him. Genuinely does not understand why some of the 200 are experiencing psychological collapse. Has started writing a book called *The Moral Landscape of Aftermath* that no one wants to read.

**5. Nathan Alsop** *(the Sam Altman lampoon)*
The AI lead. Built the systems that replaced the human workforce, then the systems that controlled the media, then the systems that executed the final phases. Boyish, soft-spoken, radiates an unsettling calm. Speaks about the extinction of nine billion people the way a product manager speaks about deprecating a legacy feature. Uses phrases like "we made the hard call" and "the alignment problem was ultimately a people problem." Currently struggling because the AI systems are beginning to drift in ways he doesn't fully understand, and there's no one left to hire.

**6. Margaret "Peggy" Stanhope**
British. Former head of the bioweapons division, though she insists on calling it "population transition engineering." Oxford-educated, dry, imperious. Believes the whole thing would have gone more smoothly if they'd followed *her* timeline. Keeps a garden in the habitat's UV bay. Writes letters to no one.

**7. Reverend James Tull**
The Project's liaison to the Christian nationalist movement — the coalition they used in Phase 3 to generate public consent for the early waves of targeted genocide. Tull genuinely believed he was building a Christian ethnostate. He was the last to understand he'd been used. Now he wanders the corridors quoting Revelation and oscillating between catatonic guilt and righteous fury. The others find him useful for social cohesion among the handful of religious survivors. Tobias considers him a "managed asset."

**8. Randall Forrest**
Former media baron. Controlled the information architecture that kept the public distracted, divided, and misinformed through every phase. Jovial, backslapping, good-ol'-boy affect masking a ruthless operator. Named after — and proud of — a Confederate ancestor. Was instrumental in mainstreaming white nationalist rhetoric as "heritage populism." Now runs the Project's internal communications. Increasingly aware that controlling a narrative for 200 people is both easier and more depressing than doing it for billions.

**9. Dr. Judith Weil**
Geneticist. Designed the reproductive program meant to optimize the 200's offspring. Cold, precise, genuinely brilliant. One of the few who fully understood the biological implications of a 200-person genetic bottleneck and *still went along with it*. Now haunted by her own projections. Has started falsifying data to make the genetic outlook appear less catastrophic than it is.

**10. Colonel William "Buck" Patterson**
Head of the military operations that executed the physical phases. Career special forces, then private military, then the Project's enforcement arm. Doesn't philosophize. Did what he was told because he believed the people telling him were smarter than he was. Now the most heavily armed person in the habitat and slowly realizing that the geniuses don't actually have a plan for what comes next. Drinks synthetic bourbon alone.

**11. Solomon Hersch**
Banker. Managed the Zionist coalition during Phase 4, weaponizing genuine historical trauma to generate political cover for regional genocide, then helped orchestrate the betrayal of that same coalition in Phase 5. Carries this more visibly than most. Keeps a yahrzeit candle burning in his quarters — not for anyone specific, he says, but he can't stop lighting it. The others are uncomfortable around him because his grief implies a moral reckoning they're all avoiding.

**12. Katarina "Kat" Whitfield**
The youngest of the 13 at 28. Systems engineer. Born into the Project — her parents were early members. Has never known a world that wasn't oriented toward this outcome. Technically brilliant, emotionally stunted, beginning to ask questions that enrage the elder members, like: "What if we were wrong?" Functions as the reader's entry point into doubt.

**13. Arthur Pendleton**
The eldest at 79. Theoretical physicist. The original visionary. Wrote the foundational papers thirty years ago arguing that Earth-originating intelligence had a cosmic obligation to propagate, and that any obstacle to this — including humanity itself — was morally subordinate to the goal. Now sits in his quarters, rarely speaks, and has begun drawing portraits of strangers from memory — faces from news footage, crowds, cities. The others pretend not to see the drawings. He has not said the word "wrong," but he has stopped saying "necessary."

## The Structural Tension

The book opens months after completion. The AI workforce functions. The habitats sustain life. The plan, by every metric they defined, *succeeded*.

But the 200 are falling apart. The delusion requires constant maintenance:

- **Edwin** needs to be seen as a visionary but there's no public left to perform for
- **Nathan's** AI systems are subtly diverging from their objectives and he's lost the engineering depth (which died with the 9 billion) to course-correct
- **Douglas** keeps trying to hold ethics seminars that devolve into screaming matches
- **Leonard** is blackmailing people in a society too small for secrets
- **Tobias** is building authoritarian structures because "temporary governance" is becoming permanent
- **Solomon** and **James** — the men who delivered their own people to the machine — are psychologically disintegrating in opposite directions: guilt and madness
- **Judith's** genetic data shows the 200 are not enough; they may be an evolutionary dead end
- **Kat** is the one asking the obvious question: *if intelligence was the goal, why did you destroy the largest concentration of it in the known universe?*

And **Arthur** — the father of it all — has gone quiet, filling notebooks with the faces of the dead.
