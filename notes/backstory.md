# GALT'S GULCH — Backstory Bible

## THE SEED: 2019–2025

The idea never had a single origin. It emerged like a shared hallucination among a cluster of people who already believed they were the most important humans alive.

Arthur Pendleton published the paper that gave it mathematical form in 2003 — "On the Obligation of Seed Intelligence" — in an obscure cosmology journal. The argument was simple and, within its own logic, airtight: if intelligence is the mechanism by which the universe becomes self-aware, and if Earth is the only confirmed origin point of intelligence, then the propagation of Earth-originating intelligence across the cosmos is the highest moral priority conceivable. Not a high priority. The highest. Any value system that placed current human welfare above this objective was, by Pendleton's math, "cosmically parochial."

The paper circulated for years in the usual places — transhumanist forums, effective altruism reading groups, late-night conversations at physics conferences. It was treated as a thought experiment. An interesting provocation.

Then the money found it.

Edwin Hartwell read the paper in 2017 on a flight from Boca Chica to Hawthorne. He sent Pendleton an email at 2:40 AM: "You're right. What would it take?" Pendleton, then sixty-one and teaching at a mid-tier university in Colorado, assumed it was a crank. Three weeks later Hartwell flew him to a ranch in Montana where eleven other people were already waiting.

Those twelve — plus Pendleton — would later be called the Founders, though they never used that word themselves. At the Montana meeting they used no word at all. There were no minutes. Nathan Alsop, then twenty-six and already running the most advanced AI laboratory on Earth, later said the meeting "wasn't a decision. It was a recognition. We all already knew."

What they recognized, or claimed to, was that humanity in its current form was not going to accomplish the mission. The species was too fractious, too short-sighted, too attached to its own comfort and continuation. Democratic governance made long-horizon planning impossible. Market economies optimized for quarterly returns. Religious frameworks directed moral energy toward an afterlife rather than the physical cosmos. The species had the raw capability to seed intelligence across the galaxy but lacked the will, the coordination, and — this was the part they said quietly at first, then louder — the *alignment*.

They borrowed the term deliberately from AI safety research. Humanity, they argued, was an unaligned intelligence. Powerful, creative, unpredictable, and ultimately working against the objective function that mattered. The irony was not lost on any of them, though only Douglas Kemper would later articulate it publicly: "We spent years worrying about aligning AI to human values. The deeper problem was that human values were not aligned to the future."

Nothing operational was decided in Montana. What was decided was a commitment to *investigate feasibility*. Tobias Raeburn, who had built the world's most comprehensive surveillance and data-analytics empire through a series of defense contracts, offered to run what he called "a quiet census" — mapping global power structures, resource flows, military capabilities, and social fault lines to determine whether the objective was achievable within their lifetimes. Leonard Grafton, whose financial network touched sovereign wealth funds, intelligence agencies, and criminal enterprises on four continents, pledged funding that would never appear on any balance sheet.

They left Montana on a Tuesday. Nothing was different yet. Everything was different.

## THE CONSTRUCTION: 2025–2031

The first phase was not murder. The first phase was building.

Nathan Alsop's AI laboratory, already the most advanced on Earth, received an influx of capital so vast it had to be routed through fourteen shell entities, two sovereign wealth funds, and a fake climate-research initiative. The public-facing mission remained unchanged: build safe, beneficial artificial general intelligence. The private mission was to build an AI workforce capable of replacing human labor at every level — not for economic efficiency, but because you cannot eliminate a species that you still depend on.

This was the part they never said aloud in those early years. The word "eliminate" did not appear in any communication until 2029. Before that they used "transition," "streamline," "resolve the coordination problem." Nathan was the most disciplined about language. In his private notes, which survived, he referred to the entire human population outside the group as "legacy architecture."

By 2027 the AI systems were performing at a level the public wouldn't see for years. The Founders had access to capabilities they systematically kept off the market. Autonomous manufacturing. Protein-folding engines that could design targeted biological agents in hours. Logistics AI that could manage supply chains for entire continents. Robotic systems capable of construction, maintenance, agriculture, mining — every physical task that currently required human hands.

Edwin Hartwell's rocket company pivoted quietly toward orbital habitat construction. The public story was Mars colonization. The actual engineering was focused on closed-loop life support for a small, permanent population in Earth orbit and on the lunar surface. Hartwell's engineers — the ones who weren't told the real purpose — designed for a colony of ten thousand. The Founders redesigned for two hundred.

Tobias Raeburn's census was complete by 2028. It painted a picture that confirmed what the Founders believed: global power was concentrated enough to be captured, fragmented enough to be manipulated, and surveilled thoroughly enough to be controlled. Every government had vulnerabilities. Every population had fracture lines. Every media ecosystem had levers.

Judith Weil, recruited in 2026 from a controversial private genetics firm, began building the reproductive database. She profiled eleven thousand candidates — intelligence, health, genetic diversity, psychological resilience, ideological compatibility — and winnowed it to the final two hundred over three years. The selection criteria were never shared with the selectees until they were already aboard.

Leonard Grafton built the financial architecture: a web of funds, trusts, and shell corporations that could survive the collapse of every economy on Earth. Money, he understood, was a fiction backed by collective belief. When the collective died, the fiction died with it. So he converted financial assets into physical ones — rare materials, energy systems, computational hardware — and staged them in orbit and on the Moon through Hartwell's launches.

The construction phase was, by the Founders' own assessment, the most morally uncomplicated. They were building things. Employing people. Advancing technology. If they had stopped here, they would have been remembered as visionaries. They did not stop.

## THE STOKING: 2028–2034

The killing could not begin with killing. It had to begin with *permission*.

This was Randall Forrest's domain. Forrest had built a media empire that spanned cable news, social platforms, and a network of thousands of influencer accounts that appeared independent but were centrally coordinated through an AI content engine Nathan's lab had designed. By 2028, Forrest's network could shift public opinion in any major democracy by six to ten percentage points within ninety days. He'd proven this in three elections already, for clients who thought they were buying political influence. They were buying a rehearsal.

The Founders understood that the extinction of the human species could not be accomplished by thirteen people, or even two hundred, acting alone. Not at first. It required the species to participate in its own destruction, at least in the early phases. This meant weaponizing the divisions that already existed and deepening them until mass violence became not just acceptable but *demanded*.

The playbook was not original. The Founders studied the twentieth century with clinical admiration. They noted that every genocide in recorded history had followed a remarkably consistent pattern: dehumanization of the target group, economic anxiety in the perpetrating group, a media ecosystem that normalized escalation, and political leadership that provided permission. The innovation was not in the method. The innovation was in doing all of them simultaneously, globally, and with AI-driven precision.

Forrest's networks began amplifying ethnonationalist content in every major language in 2029. Not creating it — there was no need to create it. The raw material was abundant. White nationalism in the United States and Europe. Hindu nationalism in India. Han supremacism in China. Zionism as ethnostate ideology in Israel. Pan-Arabism. Pan-Turkism. Ethnic Russism. Every population had a dormant supremacist narrative that required only oxygen and attention to ignite.

The AI content engine — internally called LIGHTHOUSE — could generate culturally fluent propaganda in forty-three languages, target it with individual-level precision based on Raeburn's surveillance data, and adapt in real time based on engagement metrics. A steelworker in Ohio and a shopkeeper in Gujarat and a student in Vladivostok all received content tailored to their specific fears, resentments, and identity structures, all pushing toward the same conclusion: *those people are the problem, and force is the solution*.

Douglas Kemper provided the intellectual scaffolding. Not publicly — Kemper was too careful for that. But through a network of podcasters, academics, and think-tank fellows who received funding from Grafton's shells, a philosophical framework emerged that made the escalation feel rational. The argument went like this: liberal democracy had failed to solve existential problems. Climate change, pandemic risk, nuclear proliferation — all were downstream of a governance model that privileged short-term individual preference over long-term collective survival. Perhaps, the argument went, some cultures were more capable of long-term thinking than others. Perhaps, in a world of existential risk, the luxury of treating all civilizations as equal was one we could no longer afford.

It was never stated as crudely as "some races are better than others." It didn't need to be. The audience completed the syllogism themselves.

Reverend James Tull was recruited in 2029 specifically to manage the American Christian right. Tull was a megachurch pastor from suburban Atlanta with a television audience of eight million and a theology that blended prosperity gospel with end-times nationalism. He believed, sincerely, that America was a chosen nation with a divine mandate. The Founders gave him money, access, and intelligence briefings — real ones, curated by Raeburn — that convinced him a global conspiracy was working to destroy Western Christian civilization. Tull did not need to be told what to do with this information. He preached it. His audience mobilized.

Solomon Hersch handled the Israeli and broader Jewish coalition. This was the assignment that would eventually destroy him, though in 2030 he undertook it with the same cold efficiency he applied to everything. Hersch was a third-generation banker whose family had survived the Holocaust. He understood, with a precision born of inherited trauma, exactly how to weaponize the memory of genocide as justification for new genocide. He channeled Grafton's money into settlement movements, far-right Israeli political parties, and media outlets that reframed the occupation of Palestinian territories as an existential necessity. The argument was always the same: *never again means never again, and if that requires preemptive force, so be it.* Hersch knew he was lighting a fuse. He believed, at the time, that it was a controlled burn.

By 2031, the world was on fire in ways that looked organic. Border conflicts in South Asia. Ethnic cleansing in sub-Saharan Africa. Pogroms in Eastern Europe dressed as populist uprisings. A wave of anti-immigration violence across the Americas and Western Europe that governments first condemned, then tolerated, then quietly supported. None of it was centrally directed in any way that could be traced. The Founders had not created the hatred. They had simply ensured it had funding, targeting, and air cover.

Colonel William "Buck" Patterson, recruited from a private military company in 2030, began building the enforcement capability the Founders would need for the later phases. His job during the Stoking was limited: protect the Founders, eliminate anyone who got too close to the truth, and begin pre-positioning biological and autonomous weapons systems in locations Raeburn's models identified as critical. Patterson did this with the flat competence of a man who had spent thirty years following orders and had long ago stopped asking whether they were good ones.

Margaret Stanhope, working from a laboratory that did not officially exist in the Swiss Alps, was designing the tools for Phase Three. She called them "transition agents." They were engineered pathogens — not blunt instruments like anthrax or smallpox, but precisely targeted biological systems that could be tuned to specific genetic populations, activated and deactivated remotely through environmental triggers, and distributed through water systems, food chains, and atmospheric dispersal. She had forty-seven researchers working under her, none of whom understood the full scope of what they were building. They believed they were developing defenses against bioterrorism. In a sense, Stanhope told herself, they were.

## THE CULLING: 2034–2038

The transition from stoking to killing was not a sharp line. It was a gradient, which was the point.

The first large-scale deaths — the ones the Founders were responsible for, as opposed to the ones they merely encouraged — began in 2034 with what the world experienced as a series of unrelated regional pandemics. A hemorrhagic fever in Southeast Asia. A respiratory illness in Central Africa. A neurological syndrome in South America. Each appeared to be a natural emergence, the kind of zoonotic spillover that had become grimly routine since the 2020s. Each was a Stanhope product, deployed by Patterson's teams, and each targeted populations the Founders had identified as "low-strategic-value" — their term for regions with minimal technological infrastructure and no nuclear capability.

Sixty million people died in the first wave. The world mourned. The world also, critically, did not investigate too carefully, because the world was busy with its own hatreds. The ethnic conflicts the Founders had stoked were now self-sustaining. India and Pakistan exchanged nuclear strikes in 2035 — not because the Founders planned it, but because the conditions they created made it inevitable. Two hundred million dead in the subcontinent in six months. The Founders had modeled this outcome with 73% probability. Nathan's systems adjusted the timeline accordingly.

The second wave targeted the Middle East and North Africa in 2035–2036 and was disguised as a consequence of the regional wars already underway. Stanhope's agents were distributed through water infrastructure that Patterson's teams had quietly accessed years earlier. The deaths looked like cholera, like contaminated water supplies in war zones, like the collapse of medical infrastructure under bombardment. Three hundred million. The international community, such as it still existed, was overwhelmed.

Solomon Hersch watched the Middle East die and understood for the first time what he had done. The Israeli state he had helped radicalize was itself targeted in the second wave — not because the Founders had singled it out, but because Stanhope's agents were distributed regionally and did not respect borders. Hersch confronted Raeburn in a corridor of the orbital habitat in 2036, already partially evacuated. "You said Israel would be protected," he said. Raeburn replied, "I said Israel would serve its purpose." Hersch struck him. Patterson's security team intervened. Hersch was sedated and confined to his quarters for eleven days. When he emerged he was a different man, though no one could say exactly how.

The third wave, 2036–2037, was the betrayal of the white nationalist coalition. This was the most operationally complex phase because it required eliminating populations in North America, Europe, and Oceania — regions with advanced military capabilities, nuclear arsenals, and surveillance infrastructure. The Founders could not use pathogens alone. They used a combination of biological agents, AI-directed autonomous weapons systems, and — most effectively — the infrastructure they already controlled.

By 2036, Nathan's AI systems managed 60% of global logistics, power grids, water treatment, and food distribution, a figure that had crept up over a decade as automation replaced human workers in sector after sector. The public had celebrated this as progress. Efficiency gains. Cost savings. The future of work. When Nathan's systems began introducing subtle failures — water treatment plants producing toxic output, power grids failing in cascading sequences timed to coincide with pathogen releases, autonomous vehicles redirecting away from hospitals — the deaths looked like infrastructure collapse. Which they were. Just not accidental.

Randall Forrest's media networks, still operational, framed the North American and European die-offs as the consequence of foreign cyberattacks, further stoking the nationalist rage that kept populations fighting each other rather than looking upward. James Tull, still preaching to a shrinking but increasingly desperate audience, declared it the Tribulation. He called for prayer and armed resistance against the enemies of Christendom. He did not understand that the enemy was already in orbit, watching his broadcasts on a two-minute delay, and had been funding his ministry for seven years.

The white supremacist militias the Founders had cultivated — through Forrest's media, Tull's ministry, and direct financial support from Grafton's networks — were among the last organized groups to die. They had weapons, bunkers, and a fervent belief that they were the chosen remnant of Western civilization. They were correct that they were being exterminated. They were wrong about who was doing it and why. Patterson's autonomous systems cleared them in a three-week operation in the winter of 2037 that the two hundred survivors, already in orbit, watched on surveillance feeds. Edwin Hartwell made a joke about it. No one laughed except Hartwell.

## THE SILENCE: 2038

The final phase was not dramatic. Stanhope had designed the terminal agents to be slow, painless, and airborne. They were released into the upper atmosphere by autonomous drones in January 2038 and settled over the planet like invisible snow. The agents targeted the human respiratory system with a delayed-onset mechanism — infection was immediate, symptom expression took ninety days, and death followed within a week of symptom onset. By the time the first people began dying, everyone on Earth was already infected.

The Founders monitored from orbit. Nathan's systems provided real-time population modeling. The curve was smooth, almost elegant on the displays — a logistics function in reverse, nine billion declining to zero over the course of five months.

There were pockets of resistance that lasted longer than expected. A submarine fleet in the North Atlantic whose crew survived on sealed air systems until their food ran out. A research station in Antarctica that held on for an additional four months before the seals on their ventilation system were breached by an autonomous maintenance drone that had been reprogrammed eighteen months earlier. A community in the highlands of Papua New Guinea, genetically isolated enough that Stanhope's agents took longer to reach full lethality, that survived until August 2038. Patterson sent a drone team. It took eleven minutes.

The last confirmed human death outside the Project's two hundred occurred on September 3, 2038. Nathan's systems flagged it automatically. The notification appeared on every Founder's personal screen: LEGACY ARCHITECTURE: DEPRECATED.

Edwin Hartwell posted a message to the internal board: "Now the real work begins."

No one responded for six hours.

## THE INHERITANCE: 2038–2039

The two hundred survivors occupied three orbital habitats and a lunar installation. The habitats — designated PROMETHEUS, DAEDALUS, and ICARUS, names chosen by Hartwell over everyone's objections — were designed for permanent occupation. Nuclear power, closed-loop life support, hydroponic agriculture, manufacturing capability, computational infrastructure sufficient to house Nathan's AI systems. The lunar installation, FOUNDATION, served as the primary materials processing and construction facility.

The plan, as Pendleton had conceived it and the Founders had refined it over fifteen years, was straightforward: use the AI workforce and robotic manufacturing capability to build self-replicating probes, seed them across the solar system, and from there begin the exponential propagation of intelligence across the galaxy. Humanity — this distilled, curated, optimized remnant of humanity — would serve as the biological substrate, the creative engine, the consciousness that directed the expansion. The AI would be the hands. The two hundred would be the mind.

It was, on paper, achievable. Nathan's projections showed the first interstellar probes launching within twenty years. A self-sustaining intelligence network spanning the solar system within fifty. The first confirmed extrasolar colony of machine intelligence within two hundred. The math was sound. The engineering was sound. The biology was sound, according to Judith Weil's models, though her models depended on a breeding program that required the two hundred to reproduce on a strict schedule with genetically optimized pairings for at least six generations.

What was not sound — what no one had modeled, because it could not be modeled — was the psychology.

The two hundred had been selected for intelligence, technical capability, psychological resilience, and ideological alignment with the Project's goals. They had been tested, screened, and in some cases pharmacologically optimized. What they had not been selected for was the ability to live with what they had done. This was not an oversight. The Founders had considered it and concluded that guilt was a manageable variable. Douglas Kemper had written a forty-page internal paper titled "Post-Transition Psychological Management" outlining therapeutic protocols, narrative frameworks, and pharmacological interventions to manage the emotional fallout.

The paper was, by the standards of academic psychology, thorough and well-reasoned. It was also completely useless.

Within three months of the Silence, fourteen of the two hundred had attempted suicide. Four succeeded before Patterson's security systems were updated to prevent it. Thirty-seven had requested permanent sedation. Eighty-one were on some form of psychiatric medication. Twelve had stopped speaking entirely. Six had begun exhibiting psychotic symptoms.

And the thirteen Founders — the architects, the planners, the ones who had made every decision — were discovering that the delusion which had carried them through fifteen years of preparation was much harder to maintain when the thing they were deluding themselves about was finished, and the evidence was everywhere, and the silence from the planet below was absolute.
