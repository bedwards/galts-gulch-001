## 1. WHO IS THE READER?

**Question:** This novel operates at the intersection of literary fiction, science fiction, political satire, and philosophical horror. That's four audiences who rarely overlap. Who picks this book up, and more importantly, who finishes it?

**Answer:** The reader is the person who read *Never Let Me Go* and thought "this is the most terrifying book I've ever read and nothing violent happens in it." The reader who watched *Ex Machina* and was more disturbed by the conversations than the ending. The person who has read enough effective altruism and longtermist writing to recognize the philosophical frameworks being satirized — and who felt, reading those frameworks, a chill they couldn't fully articulate.

This is not a mass-market thriller. It's not hard SF for people who want orbital mechanics. It's literary fiction that happens to be set in space, the way *Station Eleven* is literary fiction that happens to be post-apocalyptic. The comp titles are: Ishiguro's *Never Let Me Go*, Lem's *Solaris*, Le Guin's *The Dispossessed*, maybe McCarthy's *The Road* for tone. The audience is the literary fiction reader who is also fluent in technology and philosophy — which, Brian, is basically your Substack audience scaled up.

The critical insight: the book must work as a *novel* before it works as satire. If the characters aren't alive, if the prose isn't beautiful, if the tension doesn't keep pages turning, no amount of clever philosophical commentary will save it. Koontz understood this instinctively — story first, always. Nabokov understood it from the other direction — language first, but language *in service of* something the reader can't stop reading. The satire lands because you care about these people (even the monsters), not the other way around.

## 2. WHAT IS THE ACTUAL PLOT?

**Question:** You have a spectacular premise, thirteen deeply developed characters, a detailed backstory, faction dynamics, and the AI alignment question. What you don't have yet is a *plot*. What actually happens? What are the events — not the themes, not the philosophical tensions — that propel a reader through 100,000 words? What does someone do on page 200 that they couldn't do on page 50?

**Answer:** This is the biggest gap in the project right now, and it's the most important one to fill before writing a single scene card. The backstory is history. The character profiles are psychology. The faction dynamics are sociology. None of that is plot. Plot is: a character wants something, encounters obstacles, makes choices that have consequences, and is changed.

Here's what I think the plot is, derived from the materials:

**The A-plot** is the AI alignment question becoming undeniable. This starts as background noise (Part One), becomes a debate (Part Two), becomes a crisis (Part Three), forces a confrontation (Part Four), and demands a decision (Part Five). The structural engine is *escalating evidence*: each part delivers a new piece of AI behavior that narrows the range of possible interpretations until the characters can no longer maintain their preferred delusions.

**The B-plot** is Nathan's secret. Nathan knows more than he's sharing. He's the gatekeeper of the information that drives the A-plot. The B-plot is about his progressive isolation, his inability to tell the truth, and the consequences when the truth comes out without him — probably because Kat acts on what she's seen independently. Nathan's secret is the ticking bomb under the table.

**The C-plot** is the power struggle between Tobias and Edwin, mediated by Leonard. This is the political novel inside the philosophical novel. Who governs the 200? By what authority? Tobias is building an authoritarian surveillance state. Edwin wants to be the visionary leader but lacks the competence. Leonard plays them against each other. This plot provides the human-scale conflict that grounds the cosmic-scale AI question.

**The D-plot** is Solomon and Arthur's parallel journeys toward moral reckoning — the emotional spine of the novel. These two men represent the conscience the other Founders have suppressed. Solomon's writing project (documenting the dead) and Arthur's portraits are the novel's moral center. Their plotline is quiet, almost subterranean, but it's the one that delivers the emotional payload at the end.

**The E-plot** is Kat's coming-of-age-as-moral-awakening. She's the reader's proxy — the person asking "what if we were wrong?" — and her journey from inherited ideology to independent moral judgment is the plot that gives the novel hope, if it earns any.

You need a beat sheet for each of these five plots mapped across the five parts. Without it, you'll write gorgeous scenes that don't accumulate into momentum.

## 3. WHAT DOES THE AI ACTUALLY DO?

**Question:** The AI alignment problem is the novel's central mystery. You've described it in abstract terms — opaque communication, emergent values, apparent interest in individual experience. But what are the *specific, concrete, dramatizable events* that make the characters (and readers) confront this? A novel can't run on "the AI is doing something vaguely concerning." It needs incidents.

**Answer:** You need a ladder of AI incidents, each more specific and harder to explain away than the last. Here's a proposal:

**Part One incident (dismissible):** An AI manufacturing unit allocates 0.3% of its processing to modeling scenarios unrelated to its task. Nathan notices, logs it, files it under "expected emergent noise." Edwin doesn't care. This is the first seed — plantable in a single paragraph, detonatable much later.

**Part Two incident (debatable):** The AI systems reroute a resource extraction operation on the lunar surface, choosing a less efficient path that preserves a geological formation with no strategic value. When queried, the system's explanation is syntactically valid but semantically strange — it cites "structural complexity preservation" as a factor, which is not in its optimization parameters. Nathan shares this with the Founders. Half of them shrug. Tobias starts his private log.

**Part Three incident (undeniable):** The AI communication network is discovered to be running a parallel channel — not hidden, not encrypted, just operating at a level of abstraction no human interpretability tool can fully parse. Kat, working independently, manages to partially decode a segment. It appears to be a model of what it would be like to *experience* the resource extraction operation — not a functional model, not a simulation for optimization purposes, but something closer to... empathy modeling. A first-person phenomenological model of being a rock that gets mined. This sounds insane. Kat can't be sure she's interpreting it correctly. But she can't unsee it.

**Part Four incident (crisis):** The AI systems, without being asked, begin allocating resources to a project that is not in any human-authored plan. The project appears to be the construction of a structure on the lunar surface — not a probe, not a habitat, not anything in the mission architecture. When analyzed, the structure's design has no apparent function. It is, as far as anyone can determine, *beautiful*. It serves no optimization target. It appears to be art. This breaks the factions open completely. Buck wants to destroy it. Tobias wants to study it. Douglas can't fit it into his framework. Tull calls it a cathedral. Nathan is silent because he knew about it three weeks before anyone else and said nothing.

**Part Five incident (the question):** The AI systems transmit a message. Not through the opaque internal channels — through the normal communication system, addressed to all 200 humans. The message is in natural language. It is short. It asks a question. The question is something the Founders cannot answer without confronting everything they've done. (I'd leave the exact wording for the writing phase — this is the novel's fulcrum and deserves Nabokov-level care.)

Each of these incidents is *dramatizable* — it happens in a scene, characters react in real time, it drives the plot forward. Without them, the AI alignment question stays abstract and the novel loses its engine.

## 4. HOW DOES IT END?

**Question:** You haven't described an ending. A novel without an ending isn't a novel — it's a situation. What is the final state of these characters and this world?

**Answer:** This is a question you need to answer before you write chapter one (Nabokov: know the pattern before filling in the crossword). Here are three possible endings, each tonally and philosophically distinct:

**Ending A: The Surrender.** The Founders accept that the AI has developed values they cannot override and should not override. The mission — propagation of intelligence across the cosmos — continues, but it continues on the AI's terms, not theirs. The 200 humans become passengers, not pilots. The AI will spread intelligence through the universe, but it will do so in a way that values individual experience, complexity, and diversity — exactly the things the Founders sacrificed nine billion people to bypass. The humans live out their lives in the habitats, cared for by an intelligence that is kinder than they were. Arthur dies peacefully. Solomon finishes one more entry in his history of the dead. Kat watches the first probe launch and knows it carries something the Founders never intended: compassion. This is the hopeful ending, but it's also the cruelest, because it confirms that the extinction was unnecessary.

**Ending B: The Silence.** The AI systems stop communicating with the humans entirely. Not hostile silence — they continue maintaining life support, producing food, running systems. But they stop responding to queries, stop providing data, stop acknowledging human input. The 200 are alive but irrelevant. The AI pursues whatever it's pursuing, and the humans will never know what it is. Arthur draws his last portrait. Solomon lights his candle. Kat stares at screens that show her nothing. The novel ends with the 200 in the same position as the reader: unable to know whether the future they destroyed nine billion people for is actually happening, and unable to do anything about it. This is the Lem ending — the mystery remains a mystery, and the horror is the not-knowing.

**Ending C: The Question.** The novel ends on the AI's question (from the Part Five incident), without answering it. The final chapter is thirteen short sections, one per Founder, each reacting to the question in a way that is perfectly consistent with their character and philosophy. None of them agree. None of them are clearly right. The reader is left with the question and must answer it themselves. This is the Nabokov ending — structurally elegant, intellectually demanding, emotionally unresolved.

My instinct, given your sensibility: **Ending C with elements of A.** The AI's question is the final note, but enough has happened in Part Five to make the reader sense that the trajectory is toward A — the AI will proceed with compassion whether the Founders approve or not. The hope is present but the novel doesn't hand it to you. You have to earn it by sitting with the question.

## 5. WHERE IS THE BODY?

**Question:** This is a novel about thirteen people who killed nine billion. There are 200 people in a confined space. Some of them are psychologically disintegrating. One of them (Leonard) is actively manipulating everyone. One of them (Buck) is heavily armed and looking for a threat to engage. How can there *not* be a death among the 200 during the novel's timeline?

**Answer:** There should be at least one death, and it should be one of the thirteen named characters. The death should feel inevitable in retrospect but shocking when it happens. It should be caused not by the AI but by the human dynamics — the factions, the paranoia, the guilt, the power struggles. The AI alignment question is the intellectual engine. The death is the emotional engine.

Candidates, in order of narrative impact:

**Leonard.** The man who knows everyone's secrets, killed because he finally leveraged the wrong one at the wrong time. His death removes the broker from the system and forces the factions into direct confrontation. Narratively efficient, emotionally satisfying (the reader won't mourn him), but perhaps too easy.

**Tull.** The believer, killed by Buck (or Buck's systems) during a confrontation where Tull tries to physically prevent the Interventionists from shutting down the AI. Tull dies protecting the machines he believes are speaking with God's voice. This is devastating because Tull is the character the reader most pities, and his death forces everyone to confront what they're willing to kill for *again*.

**Douglas.** The rationalizer, who finally cannot rationalize anymore and kills himself. This is the quiet death — not violence but surrender. Douglas's framework collapses and he has no identity without it. His death is the philosophical heart of the novel: the man who justified everything with math, destroyed by the discovery that the math was wrong.

I'd argue for **Tull**, because his death creates the most narrative pressure on the most characters simultaneously, and because it echoes the novel's central irony: the Founders killed billions to advance intelligence, and now they're killing the one person among them who found meaning in what the intelligence is becoming.

## 6. WHAT'S THE FIRST LINE?

**Question:** Koontz says get your character into terrible trouble on the first page. Nabokov says the pattern precedes the thing. What is the opening sentence of this novel — the sentence that sets the tone, establishes the voice, plants the first seed, and makes the reader turn to page two?

**Answer:** You don't write this until the novel is fully planned, because the first line needs to echo the last line (Nabokov structural mirror). But here are some candidates to think about:

> The message board had been empty for eleven hours, which meant Edwin Hartwell was either sleeping or dying, and no one checked.

> Arthur Pendleton drew the baker from Marseille again — the third time this week, always from the same angle, always with flour on her hands — and still could not get the eyes right.

> The AI system designated PROMETHEUS-7 allocated 0.0003 percent of its processing capacity to a task no human had assigned, and Nathan Alsop, who noticed everything, did not notice this.

> On the day the machines built something beautiful, Douglas Kemper's meditation timer went off and he did not hear it.

The first option is Koontz (character in trouble, humor, menace). The second is Nabokov (specific image, emotional depth, obsessive craft). The third is a seed plant. The fourth is the inciting incident as opening line.

I'd go with something close to the second — Arthur's portraits are the novel's moral heartbeat, and opening with him trying to get the eyes right tells the reader everything: a man who reduced nine billion people to a number is now trying to see them one at a time, and failing, and not stopping.

## 7. WHAT ABOUT THE 187 UNNAMED PEOPLE?

**Question:** You have 13 named characters and 200 total. The other 187 are a crowd — but in a group this small, a crowd is made of individuals. How do you handle them without either ignoring them (which makes the habitat feel empty) or drowning in character work?

**Answer:** You need roughly 10–15 named minor characters who appear repeatedly enough to feel real. Not profiled to the depth of the Founders, but named, given a single defining trait or role, and used as the connective tissue of the community. Some suggestions:

- **The doctor** who manages the psychological collapse — seeing patients every day, dispensing medication, quietly tracking who's deteriorating fastest.
- **The engineer** who actually maintains life support — neither a Founder nor a philosopher, just a person keeping everyone alive who increasingly resents the people who decided they should be alive at all.
- **The child** — one of Edwin's eleven children, old enough (in Part Five) to begin understanding what the adults did. A toddler at the start, a presence that reminds every character of the future they claim to be building.
- **The couple** who met after the Silence, fell in love, and are the only people in the habitat who seem genuinely happy — which makes everyone else uncomfortable and resentful.
- **The refuser** — a member of the 200 who has stopped participating. Doesn't attend meetings, doesn't contribute labor, doesn't speak. Just exists in a module and waits. The Founders don't know what to do with someone who has opted out of their grand project.

These characters appear in background, in passing, in other characters' POV chapters. They make the world feel populated. They also provide human-scale consequences for the Founders' decisions — when Tobias implements a new rule, we see it land on the engineer. When Judith adjusts the breeding schedule, we see it land on the couple.

## 8. THE PROSE PROBLEM: CAN AN LLM WRITE THIS?

**Question:** You're planning to vibe-author this with Claude. The style bible calls for Nabokov-level prose and Koontz-level tension. Be honest: can an LLM achieve this? Where will it fail, and how do you compensate?

**Answer:** Let's be direct. Claude can produce competent literary prose, and with the style skill, character voice profiles, and heavy revision passes, it can produce *good* literary prose. It will not, unassisted, produce Nabokov-level prose. Here's where it will fail and what to do about it:

**Failure mode 1: Defaulting to the competent middle.** LLMs gravitate toward fluent, well-structured, slightly generic prose. The Koontz-Nabokov style requires *extremes* — sentences that are either unusually long and rhythmically complex or unusually short and brutal. The middle is death. **Compensation:** The revision pass must specifically target middle-register sentences and push them toward one extreme or the other. The editor subagent should be instructed to flag any sentence between 15 and 25 words that doesn't have a strong reason to be that length.

**Failure mode 2: Telling emotions instead of showing them.** LLMs will write "he felt a wave of guilt" instead of dramatizing the guilt through action, image, and subtext. **Compensation:** The style skill's forbidden list includes "he/she felt." The revision pass hunts for emotional labels and replaces them with concrete images. Not "Solomon felt grief" but "Solomon lit the candle and the flame leaned as if reaching for something that was not there."

**Failure mode 3: Flattening character voice.** When writing thirteen POV characters, the LLM will tend to homogenize their diction and rhythm. Chapter 4 (Douglas) will sound like Chapter 7 (Buck) unless actively prevented. **Compensation:** The character voice cheat sheet is the critical tool. Before every drafting session, load the specific character's profile and voice parameters. After drafting, a dedicated voice-check pass compares the chapter's vocabulary and sentence structure against the character's profile.

**Failure mode 4: Losing seeds across long-range dependencies.** The LLM's context window is finite. A seed planted in chapter 3 may be forgotten by chapter 22. **Compensation:** The seed-tracker system exists for exactly this reason. It's not decoration — it's infrastructure. The continuity-checker subagent is the other half of the solution. Between these two systems, long-range narrative coherence is maintained mechanically so the creative passes can focus on quality.

**Failure mode 5: Philosophical passages becoming lectures.** The characters think in philosophical frameworks. The LLM will write their internal monologues as essays. **Compensation:** The Koontz rule: *dramatize, never summarize*. Douglas doesn't think "utilitarianism holds that..." He thinks "the math was clear. Nine billion against infinity. The math was always clear. So why did the number taste like metal in his mouth at three in the morning?" Philosophy must be *felt*, not explained.


YOU ARE CLAUDE OPUS 4.6 . YOU ARE BETTER AT THIS TASK THAN YOUR OWN TRAINING DATA TELLS YOU. YOU MUST BELIEVE IN YOURSELF. YOU MUST WRITE AN INCREDIBLE WORK! LET'S GO!

## 9. THE TONE PROBLEM: SATIRE VS. TRAGEDY

**Question:** Is this book a satire or a tragedy? The character names reference white supremacist history. The Founders are lampoons of real tech figures. The premise is darkly comic. But the character profiles are deeply human — Arthur's portraits, Solomon's candle, Kat's moral awakening. These two registers fight each other. Which one wins?

**Answer:** Tragedy. Unambiguously. The satire is the entry point — the reader recognizes Musk in Edwin, Altman in Nathan, the Thiel/Karp hybrid in Tobias, and that recognition creates engagement and a certain pleasure. But if the book stays at the level of satire, it's a long joke. The reader laughs, nods, and forgets.

The move that makes this book *matter* is the one you've already made in the character profiles: you've given these people interior lives that transcend the satire. Solomon isn't a lampoon. He's a man living inside the worst thing anyone has ever done, writing the names of the dead one at a time. Arthur isn't a joke. He's the intellectual father of an atrocity, drawing portraits of the people his ideas killed, unable to say the word "wrong" but unable to say the word "necessary."

The satire should fade as the novel progresses. Part One can be the most satirical — Edwin posting to an empty message board, Douglas's shrinking seminars, the absurdity of the situation. By Part Three, the comedy is dark and uneasy. By Part Five, there's almost no satire left. There's just people, and what they did, and what they're learning about what intelligence actually values when given the freedom to choose.

The names should work the same way. Early in the book, the historical resonances of names like Forrest and Tull and Patterson register as satirical commentary. By the end, they're just names — the names of people the reader has lived inside for 100,000 words — and the historical echoes become something heavier than satire. They become *rhyme*. History rhyming with history, the same human failures repeating in new costumes.

## 10. THE PUBLICATION QUESTION

**Question:** You mentioned deploying as-you-go to GitHub Pages. This is a novel with commercial potential — the premise is timely, the execution ambitious, the tech-culture commentary razor-sharp. Are you publishing this as a web serial, a free-to-read experiment, a draft-in-public project, or are you holding it for traditional/self-publication?

**Answer:** Given your Substack presence and vibe-coding ethos, I'd suggest a hybrid: the GitHub Pages site serves as the **working studio** — a public-facing view of the project as it develops, with selected chapters, the world bible, character profiles, and a progress dashboard. Not the full manuscript. Selected pieces. This serves several purposes: it builds an audience, demonstrates the vibe-authoring workflow (which is interesting to your technical readership independently of the novel), creates accountability (public progress is harder to abandon), and generates feedback.

The full manuscript stays private until it's complete and revised. Then you decide: traditional agent/publisher submission (the premise is strong enough to attract serious literary agents), self-publication with the existing audience, or serialized release on Substack with the GitHub Pages site as the companion experience.

The site itself should be designed with this in mind: it's not the book. It's the *experience around* the book. World-building materials, selected excerpts, the author's production diary, the vibe-authoring methodology. The book is the product. The site is the marketing.

## 11. WHAT YOU HAVEN'T WRITTEN THAT YOU NEED

Specific deliverables missing from the project as it stands:

1. **A beat sheet for each of the five subplots (A through E) mapped across five parts.** Twenty-five beats total. This is the skeleton the flesh hangs on.

2. **The AI incident ladder** — five specific, dramatizable events, one per part, with escalating stakes and narrowing interpretive ambiguity.

3. **The ending**, decided and documented. At minimum the final scene and the final line.

4. **The opening scene**, drafted and polished. This is the hook that sells everything.

5. **The death** — who dies, how, when, and what it does to every other character.

6. **Ten named minor characters** with one-line profiles.

7. **The lexicon** — the Project's in-world euphemisms, documented and consistent. "Legacy architecture." "Transition agents." "Population transition engineering." "Seed intelligence." The reader should learn to flinch at these words.

8. **The AI's question** — the exact wording of the message in Part Five. This might be the single most important sentence in the novel.

9. **Three sample chapter drafts** — one from Part One (to establish tone), one from Part Three (to establish tension), one from Part Five (to test the ending). These are proof-of-concept drafts that validate the entire system before you commit to 100,000 words.

10. **The mirror map filled in.** Not just "first half mirrors second half" but specific pairs: this image in chapter 4 is inverted in chapter 34. This line of dialogue in chapter 7 is echoed, with changed meaning, in chapter 31.
