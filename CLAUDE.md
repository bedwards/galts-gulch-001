# Galt's Gulch — Project Constitution

## Identity
This is a literary novel. Prose quality is paramount. Every sentence
matters. Never sacrifice style for speed.

## Style
Read .claude/skills/koontz-nabokov-style/SKILL.md before writing
ANY prose. This is non-negotiable.

## Rules
- NEVER write exposition dumps. Show through scene, dialogue, action.
- NEVER summarize what can be dramatized.
- NEVER use the word "suddenly" (Koontz rule).
- NEVER start a chapter with backstory or weather.
- ALWAYS end chapters on a turn — a question, a revelation, a silence.
- ALWAYS check bible/ for character facts before writing dialogue.
- ALWAYS check structure/seed-tracker.md before writing any scene.
- ALWAYS check bible/timeline.md for what has happened before this scene.
- Characters speak differently. Nathan: precise, short. Edwin: grandiose,
  run-on. Douglas: measured, podcast-cadence. Solomon: sparse or silent.
  Tull: biblical. Kat: direct. Arthur: almost never.

## Context Pointers
- Character profiles: bible/characters/
- AI behavior specs: bible/ai-systems.md
- Timeline: bible/timeline.md
- Seed tracker: structure/seed-tracker.md

## Workflow

2. Write scene cards first, then assemble into chapter
3. After writing: update structure/seed-tracker.md and bible/timeline.md
4. After a chapter is complete: run /seed-check and /status
