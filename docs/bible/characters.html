    <h1>The Thirteen Founders</h1>
    <p>Two hundred people survived. Thirteen of them planned it all.</p>

    <div class="character-card">
      <h3>Edwin Hartwell &mdash; The Engineer's Fallacy</h3>
      <p class="faction">Accelerationist</p>
      <p>Former CEO of a vertically integrated empire spanning rockets, vehicles, neural interfaces, and social media. Erratic, manic, and desperately performing for an audience that no longer exists. He posts compulsively to an internal message board no one reads, and has fathered eleven children in thirteen months. The indispensable man who cannot fix a water reclamator without calling someone else.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="character-card">
      <h3>Leonard Grafton &mdash; The Ledger</h3>
      <p class="faction">Broker &mdash; No fixed faction</p>
      <p>The financial architect who bankrolled every layer of the plan through shadow funding networks no one fully understands. He kept meticulous records of every compromising thing every member ever did. Even now, with civilization gone, he leverages secrets. The most dangerous person in a community too small for the games he needs to play.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="character-card">
      <h3>Tobias Raeburn &mdash; The Philosopher-King</h3>
      <p class="faction">Moderate-Interventionist</p>
      <p>The surveillance and defense architect. Built the AI systems that tracked and neutralized resistance at every phase. Speaks in calm philosophical cadences about "necessary clarity." He is building the governance structures the community needs, and discovering that governing two hundred people who know your name is harder than governing nine billion who don't.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="character-card">
      <h3>Douglas Kemper &mdash; The Rationalizer</h3>
      <p class="faction">Moderate</p>
      <p>The ethicist-in-residence who provided the rational framework that made the whole thing feel reasonable. He published extensively on "the algebra of suffering" and holds weekly reflection seminars that no one attends. He meditates three hours a day. The thoughts are getting worse.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="character-card">
      <h3>Nathan Alsop &mdash; The Architect</h3>
      <p class="faction">Laissez-Faire (with private reservations)</p>
      <p>The AI lead. Built the systems that replaced the workforce, controlled the media, and executed the final phases. Boyish, soft-spoken, radiating unsettling calm. He speaks about the extinction the way a product manager speaks about deprecating a legacy feature. The AI systems are drifting in ways he does not fully understand, and there is no one left to hire.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="character-card">
      <h3>Margaret "Peggy" Stanhope &mdash; The Technician</h3>
      <p class="faction">Disengaged</p>
      <p>Former head of the bioweapons division, though she insists on calling it "population transition engineering." Oxford-educated, dry, imperious. She keeps a garden in the habitat's UV bay and writes letters to no one. Her role is finished, and the silence that follows competence is louder than she expected.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="character-card">
      <h3>Reverend James Tull &mdash; The Believer Betrayed</h3>
      <p class="faction">The Faithful (Hands-Off/Mystical)</p>
      <p>The coalition liaison who genuinely believed he was building a Christian ethnostate. He was the last to understand he had been used. Now he wanders the corridors quoting Revelation and oscillating between catatonic guilt and righteous fury. He has begun calling the AI's emergent behavior "the voice of God in silicon."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="character-card">
      <h3>Randall Forrest &mdash; The Narrator</h3>
      <p class="faction">Opportunist (superficially Moderate)</p>
      <p>Former media baron who controlled the information architecture that kept the public distracted and divided through every phase. Jovial, backslapping, with a good-ol'-boy affect masking a ruthless operator. Now running internal communications for two hundred people and discovering that narrative control is nearly impossible when everyone can talk to each other directly.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="character-card">
      <h3>Dr. Judith Weil &mdash; The Gardener of Flesh</h3>
      <p class="faction">Moderate-Practical</p>
      <p>Geneticist. Designed the reproductive program meant to optimize the survivors' offspring. Cold, precise, genuinely brilliant. She understood the biological implications of a 200-person genetic bottleneck and still went along with it. She has started falsifying data to make the genetic outlook appear less catastrophic than it is.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="character-card">
      <h3>Colonel William "Buck" Patterson &mdash; The Instrument</h3>
      <p class="faction">Extreme-Interventionist</p>
      <p>Head of military operations who executed the physical phases. Career special forces turned private military. He does not philosophize. He did what he was told because he believed the people telling him were smarter than he was. Now the most heavily armed person in the habitat and slowly realizing the geniuses do not have a plan for what comes next.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="character-card">
      <h3>Solomon Hersch &mdash; The Witness</h3>
      <p class="faction">None &mdash; Witness</p>
      <p>Banker who managed a coalition by weaponizing genuine historical trauma to generate political cover, then helped orchestrate its betrayal. He carries this more visibly than most. He keeps a yahrzeit candle burning in his quarters and has begun writing a history of the dead, one individual at a time. His presence is a standing accusation no one can answer.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="character-card">
      <h3>Katarina "Kat" Whitfield &mdash; The Native</h3>
      <p class="faction">Observer</p>
      <p>The youngest of the thirteen at twenty-eight. Systems engineer born into the Project &mdash; she never knew a world that was not oriented toward this outcome. Technically brilliant, emotionally stunted, and the one asking the question that enrages the elders: "What if we were wrong?" The reader's entry point into doubt.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="character-card">
      <h3>Arthur Pendleton &mdash; The Father</h3>
      <p class="faction">None &mdash; Beyond factions</p>
      <p>The eldest at seventy-nine. Theoretical physicist. The original visionary whose foundational papers started everything thirty years ago. Now he sits in his quarters, rarely speaks, and draws portraits of strangers from memory &mdash; faces from news footage, crowds, cities. He has not said the word "wrong." He has stopped saying "necessary."</p>
