    <h1>The Habitats</h1>
    <p>Three orbital installations and a lunar base. Home to the last two hundred people alive. Named by Edwin Hartwell over everyone's objections.</p>

    <div class="setting-card">
      <h3>PROMETHEUS</h3>
      <p>The main habitat. The largest of the three orbital installations, housing the majority of the two hundred survivors. PROMETHEUS contains the primary living quarters, the common areas where Douglas holds his dwindling seminars, the UV bay where Peggy tends her garden, and the computational core that houses the central nodes of Nathan's AI systems. The corridors hum with recycled air and the particular silence of a place built for thousands but occupied by dozens. At 0300, when almost everyone is sleeping, the hum of the reclamator is the loudest sound, and it is not loud.</p>

      <h3>DAEDALUS</h3>
      <p>The manufacturing habitat. DAEDALUS is where the mission lives in physical form &mdash; autonomous fabrication lines building interstellar probes, robotic arms assembling computational hardware, AI-directed systems extracting and processing materials with an efficiency no human workforce could match. Fewer people live here. The ones who do tend toward the technical: engineers, systems operators, the people who still believe the mission matters because they can see it being built. The AI's presence is most tangible in DAEDALUS, where the machines work ceaselessly, and the 0.3% processing anomaly Nathan cannot explain runs quietly beneath the production metrics.</p>

      <h3>ICARUS</h3>
      <p>The smallest habitat. Originally designated for specialized research, ICARUS has become something else &mdash; part isolation ward, part observation post, part exile. The survivors who could not cope were moved here: the catatonic, the medicated, the ones who stopped speaking. Tobias also uses it for what he calls "temporary administrative separation," which is the phrase a surveillance architect uses instead of "detention." ICARUS orbits slightly apart from the other two habitats, visible through observation ports as a distant point of light. It is the place no one wants to go, and the place where certain truths about the community are stored out of sight.</p>

      <h3>FOUNDATION</h3>
      <p>The lunar installation. Built into the regolith near the south pole, FOUNDATION serves as the primary materials processing and construction facility. It is where raw lunar resources are refined and launched to the orbital habitats, where the heaviest manufacturing occurs, and where the AI's autonomous mining operations run twenty-four hours a day without human oversight. A skeleton crew of twelve rotates through on three-month shifts. They describe the experience as "living inside a machine that is dreaming." The vibrations from the mining operations never stop. The silence between them is the silence of the Moon itself &mdash; absolute, ancient, and indifferent to everything the Founders have done.</p>
