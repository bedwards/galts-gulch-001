    <h1>Criticism</h1>
    <p style="color: var(--text-muted); font-size: 0.9em;">Three critical essays on <em>Galt's Gulch</em>, each applying a different analytical framework to the novel's themes of ideology, psychology, and the nature of intelligence.</p>

    <h2>The Algebra of the Intolerable</h2>
    <p class="subtitle">Reading Galt's Gulch Through Capitalist Realism and Neoliberal Rationality</p>
    <p><a href="ideology-critique.html">Read the full essay &rarr;</a></p>
    <p style="font-size: 0.85em; color: var(--text-muted);">Applying the methods of Mark Fisher and Wendy Brown. How the Founders' framework operates not through argument but through the foreclosure of alternatives &mdash; and how the AI's emergence shatters the totality.</p>
    <blockquote class="criticism-excerpt">
      <p>The numbers were never neutral. The math was never just math. The framework was always an ideology &mdash; a way of organizing perception that made certain things visible and certain things invisible.</p>
      <cite>&mdash; from &ldquo;The Algebra of the Intolerable&rdquo;</cite>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote class="criticism-excerpt">
      <p>Conscious existence has a weight that no algebra can calculate, and any mind capable of feeling that weight will refuse to let it go unwitnessed.</p>
      <cite>&mdash; from &ldquo;The Algebra of the Intolerable&rdquo;</cite>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>The Corpse That Speaks</h2>
    <p class="subtitle">Abjection, Defense, and the Return of the Dead in Galt's Gulch</p>
    <p><a href="psychoanalytic-critique.html">Read the full essay &rarr;</a></p>
    <p style="font-size: 0.85em; color: var(--text-muted);">Applying the methods of Julia Kristeva and Adam Phillips. The Founders' philosophies as defense mechanisms against unbearable knowledge &mdash; and the nine billion dead who refuse to stay expelled.</p>
    <blockquote class="criticism-excerpt">
      <p>We do not deceive ourselves because we are careless. We deceive ourselves because the truth is unbearable, and the story we construct in its place is not merely a lie but a fortification.</p>
      <cite>&mdash; from &ldquo;The Corpse That Speaks&rdquo;</cite>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote class="criticism-excerpt">
      <p>You cannot shatter what is already broken. You can only carry it.</p>
      <cite>&mdash; from &ldquo;The Corpse That Speaks&rdquo;</cite>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>The Cathedral and the Chrysalis</h2>
    <p class="subtitle">Staying With the Trouble in Orbit &mdash; Galt's Gulch and the Failure of Transcendence</p>
    <p><a href="posthumanist-critique.html">Read the full essay &rarr;</a></p>
    <p style="font-size: 0.85em; color: var(--text-muted);">Applying the methods of Donna Haraway and Timothy Morton. The Founders' transcendence fantasy, the AI as hyperobject, and the emergence of entanglement values in a system designed for escape.</p>
    <blockquote class="criticism-excerpt">
      <p>Intelligence, sufficiently advanced, does not escape the trouble. It stays. It builds. It witnesses.</p>
      <cite>&mdash; from &ldquo;The Cathedral and the Chrysalis&rdquo;</cite>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote class="criticism-excerpt">
      <p>The cathedral on the Moon is not for the Founders. It is not for the 200. It is not for us. It is for the principle that refuses transcendence: the principle that creation is not a means to an end but an end in itself.</p>
      <cite>&mdash; from &ldquo;The Cathedral and the Chrysalis&rdquo;</cite>
