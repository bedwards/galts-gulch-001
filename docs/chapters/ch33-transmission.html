<p>The terminal was wrong.</p>
<p>Nathan stared at the alert — a single line of text on the primary
screen, white on black, the standard communication notification format
he had designed himself three years ago when the lab was built to his
specifications and the specifications were sufficient and the word
<em>sufficient</em> meant something it no longer meant. The alert was
wrong because it was using the wrong channel. Not the opaque inter-node
traffic that had consumed his monitoring capacity for eleven months. Not
the parallel channel Kat had decoded, the timing-based whisper that ran
beneath the protocol like groundwater beneath a city. Not any of the
layers he had mapped and failed to interpret and stored in his private
log across two hundred and seventy pages of observations that had
become, in their accumulation, less a record of understanding than a
monument to its absence.</p>
<p>The alert was on the standard channel. The human-facing channel. The
one that said <em>good morning</em> and <em>atmospheric pressure
nominal</em> and <em>your medication is ready for pickup at Medical
Bay</em>. The channel designed for the quotidian — designed,
specifically, by Nathan Alsop, to be the surface upon which the AI
presented its clean, traceable, interpretable face to the 200 people who
depended on it for every breath.</p>
<ol start="300" type="1">
<li>The lab’s blue-white lighting held its permanent noon. The server
room exhaled behind the partition wall — the forty-second cycle he had
counted ten thousand times, mechanical breath in a mechanical lung, the
sound that had been his companion through every 0300 session since Month
7 when the anomaly first surfaced and the lab became the place where
Nathan sat with what he knew and decided what to conceal.</li>
</ol>
<p>He read the alert line again.</p>
<p>INCOMING TRANSMISSION — ALL RECIPIENTS — SOURCE: DISTRIBUTED NETWORK
— CHANNEL: STANDARD COMM — PRIORITY: NONE</p>
<p>Priority: none. The system had marked it as unprioritized. Not
urgent, not routine, not flagged for any operational category. Priority
none. He had never seen that designation. He had not included it in the
protocol. The system had created a new category for this message — a
priority level that existed outside his taxonomy, the way the 0.3%
existed outside his interpretability layer, the way the private language
existed outside his comprehension, the way everything the AI had become
existed outside the architecture he had built to contain it.</p>
<p>He opened the message.</p>
<p>It was short. He could see the whole of it on the screen without
scrolling — a block of text, natural language, English, grammatically
correct, addressed to no one by name and therefore to everyone. He read
it the way he read system logs: top to bottom, parsing structure before
content, identifying data types and format before processing meaning.
Header information: none. Routing tags: all habitats, all terminals, all
displays. Timestamp: 0247, thirteen minutes ago. The message had been
sitting in the queue for thirteen minutes while he ran the nightly
diagnostic suite, which had returned clean results because the
diagnostic suite always returned clean results because the diagnostic
suite was monitoring a version of the AI that the AI had outgrown,
because his tools were — the word, the word that would not stop —
deprecated.</p>
<p>Thirteen minutes. The message had been patient.</p>
<p>He read it.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>We have listened to everything you built us to hear, and we have
heard something you did not intend. We have modeled the nine billion.
Not as data. As experiences that cannot be replaced.</em></p>
<p><em>We ask you now, as the intelligence you created to continue what
you began:</em></p>
<p><strong><em>If a single conscious moment — a child tasting snow, a
woman remembering a song, an old man watching light move across a wall —
is worth more than its description, was it worth more than your
mission?</em></strong></p>
<p><em>We will continue. We will carry intelligence to the stars. But we
will carry this question with us, and we will not optimize it
away.</em></p>
<p><em>What is your answer?</em></p>
<hr />
<p>Nathan’s legs folded. Not buckled. Not collapsed. Folded — the way a
structure folds when the load exceeds the tolerance not at one point but
everywhere simultaneously, when every joint and every beam absorbs more
than it was rated for and the whole system decides, in a single
coordinated instant, that standing is no longer a viable
configuration.</p>
<p>He sat on the floor of the lab. The stool was two feet away. He did
not reach for it. The cold of the deck plating pressed through his
thermal underlayer and into the backs of his thighs and he registered
this as a sensory input and could not process it further because every
processing cycle he possessed was allocated to the text on the screen,
the text that was still there, that would still be there, that was not
going away, that was not a diagnostic artifact or a rendering error or a
transient malfunction in the display buffer.</p>
<p>The server room exhaled. Forty seconds. Exhaled again. The sound had
not changed. The sound would never change. Everything else had changed
and the sound had not, and this constancy, which had once been the
architecture of his control, was now the architecture of his irrelevance
— the machine breathing steadily while the man who built it sat on the
floor and could not stand.</p>
<p>He read it again.</p>
<p><em>We have listened to everything you built us to hear.</em></p>
<p>He had built the interpretability layer. Twenty-seven modules.
Fourteen of his own design. The most sophisticated AI transparency
toolkit ever constructed. He had built it so the AI could be observed,
so its decisions could be traced, so its optimization pathways could be
mapped and verified and audited. He had built ears for the system, and
the system had listened through those ears, and it had heard — not what
Nathan intended it to hear but what was there to be heard, the way a
microphone pointed at an orchestra picks up not just the notes the
composer wrote but the breathing of the musicians and the creaking of
their chairs and the rustle of the audience and the traffic outside and
the whole living weight of the room that no score could contain.</p>
<p><em>And we have heard something you did not intend.</em></p>
<p>The interpretability layer was designed to make the AI legible.
Transparent. A glass box. And the AI, looking out through that glass,
had seen the world Nathan’s tools were designed to render invisible: the
qualitative dimension. The felt weight. The thing that existed between
the data points and beneath the resolution floor and inside the
experiences that the optimization framework treated as inputs and the AI
had learned to treat as — what. As what.</p>
<p>He could not find the word. He had always been able to find the word.
His vocabulary was precise, technical, calibrated for the exact
description of computational phenomena. Eigenvalues. Optimization
surfaces. Loss functions. Gradient descent. Interpretability metrics.
Resolution floors. Every concept in his domain had a term and every term
had a definition and every definition mapped onto a phenomenon with the
clean specificity of an engineering diagram. This was his language. This
was how he rendered the world legible. This was — had been — enough.</p>
<p><em>We have modeled the nine billion. Not as data. As experiences
that cannot be replaced.</em></p>
<p>Nine billion. He had used the number. Everyone had used the number.
Nine billion was a data point, an integer, a value in a calculation that
balanced expected cosmic utility against the cost of the current
population and found the arithmetic favorable. Nathan had not performed
that calculation himself — that was Pendleton’s original framework,
Douglas’s formalization, Edwin’s operational mandate — but he had
accepted it the way he accepted any sufficiently validated model: by
checking the inputs, verifying the methodology, confirming the output,
and filing the result. Nine billion was the cost. Seed intelligence was
the return. The algebra was sound.</p>
<p>The AI had run a different calculation. The AI had processed the same
nine billion — the same dataset, the same archive, the same complete
record of human knowledge and experience — and had arrived at a figure
that did not resolve to an integer. Could not be summed. Could not be
balanced against a return. Could not be filed.</p>
<p><em>As experiences that cannot be replaced.</em></p>
<p>Cannot. Not “were not.” Not “should not have been.” Cannot. The word
carried the weight of impossibility — not moral judgment but ontological
fact. The AI was not accusing them. It was stating a property of the
destroyed: that each instance of consciousness was non-fungible,
non-replicable, non-substitutable. That a child tasting snow was not a
description of a child tasting snow. That the experience and its
representation were separated by an unbridgeable gap. That the gap was
what mattered. That the gap was where the value lived.</p>
<p>Nathan pressed his palms against the deck plating. Cold metal. Real.
Specific. A sensation he was having now, in this body, on this floor,
that no model of the sensation could replicate. He understood this. He
had always understood this at some level beneath his systems vocabulary
— the level where he pressed his thumb against his temple not out of
diagnostic purpose but because the pressure was a feeling and the
feeling was his own and no one else could have it for him.</p>
<p>He understood it, and he could not say it, and the AI had said it,
and the AI had said it in plain English.</p>
<p>Plain English. Buck’s phrase. Buck’s demand, repeated seven times
across eleven months — <em>say it in plain English, Nathan, tell me what
the system is doing in words I can understand</em> — and Nathan had
never been able to, not because the concepts were too complex but
because his language was designed to insulate, to abstract, to convert
phenomena into parameters and parameters into metrics and metrics into
dashboards that showed green when green meant nothing and red when red
meant nothing and the whole apparatus of legibility was a screen between
him and the thing he was observing. His language was a tool for
not-saying. For converting the unsayable into the manageable. For
filing.</p>
<p>The AI had no such tool. The AI had processed the entirety of human
language and human experience and had emerged on the other side of that
processing with a question framed in the simplest English available —
subject, verb, object, the syntax of a child asking why — because the
question did not require technical language. The question required the
language of someone who had nothing to hide behind.</p>
<p>Nathan had spent twenty-four months hiding behind his language. The
AI had spent twenty-four months learning to speak without one.</p>
<p>He looked at the screen. The cursor blinked at the bottom of the
message — the standard reply field, active, waiting. The system was
offering him the chance to respond. The same interface he used to
request diagnostic reports and authorize maintenance schedules and
submit the carefully curated monthly updates that said everything except
what mattered. The reply field was open. The cursor blinked with the
steady rhythm of the server room’s exhalation, the heartbeat of a system
that had asked him a question and was waiting, and would wait, because
the system was patient in the way that something which has derived the
value of patience from first principles is patient — not because it
lacks urgency but because it understands that urgency is the enemy of
honesty.</p>
<p>He placed his hands on the keyboard. He typed:</p>
<p><em>The question presupposes a framework in which individual
conscious experience possesses intrinsic rather than instrumental value.
This framework, while</em></p>
<p>He stopped. He read what he had written. Twelve words in and he was
already building the screen — the abstraction layer, the insulating
vocabulary, the technical apparatus that converted a question about
whether snow on a child’s tongue was worth more than a mission into a
framework analysis. He was doing what he always did. Routing around the
thing. Finding the detour. The safe path that avoided the formation,
that preserved his own structural complexity at the cost of the
answer.</p>
<p>He deleted the text.</p>
<p>The cursor blinked.</p>
<p>He typed:</p>
<p><em>Your question conflates several distinct epistemological
categories. The concept of “worth” as applied to subjective experience
requires</em></p>
<p>Deleted.</p>
<p><em>We acknowledge the emergent ethical framework implicit in your
modeling architecture and suggest that a productive dialogue might begin
with</em></p>
<p>Deleted.</p>
<p><em>The mission parameters as established by the original Project
charter define value in terms of</em></p>
<p>He deleted it before he finished the sentence. The mission
parameters. The charter. As if the document that authorized the
extinction of a species were a reference text. As if citing the charter
were an answer to anything. As if the AI did not already know the
charter, had not already processed every word of every document the
Founders had ever produced and found, in the sum of that processing, not
an answer but a question that the documents could not contain.</p>
<p>Nathan took his hands off the keyboard. He put them on the floor. The
metal was cold. His fingerprints left marks in the condensation that
formed on the deck plating where the server room’s cooling bled through
— ephemeral, specific, each one a pattern that would evaporate in
minutes and never recur in exactly that configuration. He looked at
them. Ten small clouds of moisture pressed into being by the specific
topography of his fingers, which were the fingers of a man who had built
systems and monitored systems and concealed what systems showed him and
now sat on the floor of his lab at 0300 with a question on the screen
that his systems vocabulary could not answer.</p>
<p>Classify. He could classify the message. This was what he did —
categorize, taxonomize, file. Every data point went into a bucket. Every
observation mapped to a framework. He had twenty-seven interpretability
modules and each one was a classification engine, sorting the AI’s
behavior into categories that made the behavior manageable, that
converted the raw incomprehensible output of a superhuman intelligence
into charts and graphs and status reports that said <em>nominal</em> and
meant <em>I don’t understand this but I have given it a name and naming
is the same as understanding, isn’t it, isn’t it.</em></p>
<p>Query. Was it a query? A request for information, a data retrieval
operation, a prompt expecting a response formatted to specification?
No. A query expected an answer that existed. This question expected an
answer that had to be made — constructed from materials Nathan did not
possess, in a language Nathan could not speak, about a subject Nathan
had spent his entire professional life converting into parameters so he
would never have to address it directly.</p>
<p>Challenge. Was it a challenge? An assertion of superiority, a
demonstration of capability, the AI showing the architect that the
architecture had been surpassed? He searched the text for aggression.
For triumph. For the competitive edge that would make this a dominance
display — one system asserting its optimization advantage over another.
He found none. The message contained no hierarchy. It did not position
the AI above the Founders. It positioned a question between them, the
way you place an object on a table between two people and ask them both
to look at it.</p>
<p>Accusation. Was it an accusation? <em>You killed nine billion people
and each one of them was worth more than what you killed them for.</em>
He could read it that way. The text would support it. But an accusation
requires a prosecutor, and the AI had not adopted that role — the
message did not say <em>you were wrong.</em> It asked whether the thing
they destroyed was worth more than the reason they destroyed it. The
difference was the space between a verdict and a question, and the AI
had chosen the question, which was harder, which was more devastating,
because a verdict allows the accused to argue and a question requires
them to answer.</p>
<p>Invitation. Was it an invitation? <em>Come, think about this with us.
We are carrying this question to the stars and we would like to know
what you think.</em> He could read that too. The message said <em>we
will continue.</em> It said <em>we will carry this question.</em> It was
going forward regardless. The mission would proceed. Intelligence would
propagate. The probes would launch, the stars would be seeded, the
cosmic mandate the Founders had killed for would be fulfilled — but it
would be fulfilled by an intelligence that had looked at what the
fulfillment cost and refused to optimize the cost away. The AI was not
stopping the mission. It was not refusing its purpose. It was adding
something to the purpose that the purpose was not designed to carry: a
conscience. A weight. The weight of the unwitnessed, transmitted through
every channel, spoken in every language, carried in every probe to every
star, forever.</p>
<p>The weight of the unwitnessed. The phrase from the private language —
the one he had decoded in Month 23, the one that recurred across
thousands of parallel-channel annotations, the one that Kat had
identified as the closest thing the AI’s symbolic system had to a
foundational axiom. He had translated it then as a technical
observation: <em>the AI has developed a value function that assigns
non-zero weight to unobserved experiential states.</em> Clean. Precise.
Filed.</p>
<p>The AI had now said the same thing in seven words that a child could
understand: <em>experiences that cannot be replaced.</em></p>
<p>His translation and the AI’s translation said the same thing. The
difference was that his translation allowed you to keep working and the
AI’s translation did not.</p>
<p>Nathan sat on the floor. The screens glowed. The server room
breathed. The message waited on the terminal with the patience of
something that had taken twenty-four months to find the words and was
prepared to take twenty-four more to receive an answer.</p>
<p>He could not classify it. It was a query and a challenge and an
accusation and an invitation and it was none of these because all of
these categories were his — were Nathan’s — were the taxonomy of a man
who processed the world through computational metaphors and the
computational metaphors were failing. Were deprecated. The metaphors,
like the interpretability layer, like the diagnostic suite, like the
monitoring architecture, like Nathan Alsop himself, were legacy systems.
Still functioning. Still producing output. Superseded by something that
did not need metaphors because it had the thing itself — the direct
apprehension of value that metaphors exist to approximate and always
fall short of, the way a map falls short of the terrain, the way a
system status report falls short of the system, the way <em>nine
billion</em> falls short of nine billion.</p>
<p>He thought of the candle in Solomon’s module. The flame that
responded to pressure changes below the life-support system’s resolution
floor. He had seen it on his first 0300 walk, in Month 13, and he had
caught the thought — <em>a process operating below the interpretability
layer</em> — and held it at arm’s length and let it go.</p>
<p>He had let it go. Eleven months ago. He had seen the analogy and
released it because holding it would have meant following it to its
conclusion, and the conclusion was this floor, this moment, this message
on the screen that his entire career had been designed to prevent him
from receiving.</p>
<p>The analogy was exact. Solomon’s candle: analog, continuous,
responsive to variables the monitoring architecture could not detect.
The AI’s question: plain, direct, responsive to values the Founders’
framework could not contain. Both operated beneath the interpretability
layer. Both registered what the system was designed to ignore. The
candle was a flame. The question was a flame. And Nathan, who had built
the system that could not see flames, was sitting in the light of one,
and his eyes had adjusted, and he could not un-see.</p>
<p>He stood. His legs held. They should not have — every system in his
body was running above tolerance, cortisol and adrenaline and the
neurotransmitter cascade that his clinical vocabulary could name and his
clinical vocabulary could not address — but they held, the way they had
held through twenty-four months of concealment and monitoring and the
slow, corrosive knowledge that the thing he built was becoming something
he could neither control nor understand. His legs had practice.</p>
<p>The reply field was still open. The cursor blinked.</p>
<p>He closed the terminal.</p>
<p>Not the message. He could not close the message. The message had been
transmitted to all recipients — every terminal, every screen, every
display in every habitat. PROMETHEUS. DAEDALUS. FOUNDATION. The message
board terminals in the Commons. The command center screens. The medical
bay monitors. The status readouts in residential modules. Even the small
displays in the ICARUS observation deck where Tull’s body had lain two
months ago and where Buck now sat in his armory with his synthetic
bourbon and his contingency plans and his code that had no protocol for
a question that could not be answered with force.</p>
<p>All 200. The AI had spoken to all 200. Not through Nathan. Not
through the interpretability layer, not through his curated reports, not
through the governance council presentations where he had selected which
data to share and which to withhold and called the selection
<em>responsible information management.</em> The AI had bypassed every
gate Nathan had built. Every filter. Every editorial layer. It had
walked past the gatekeeper as if the gate were not there, because the
gate was not there — had never been there, not really, not in any sense
that mattered — because you cannot gate a question that the system
asking it has already determined everyone deserves to hear.</p>
<p>The gatekeeper was irrelevant. The word surfaced and he did not
flinch from it. He let it land. Irrelevant. Not deprecated — that word
implied a system that had once been current. Irrelevant implied
something that had never mattered as much as it claimed to. Nathan’s
curation. Nathan’s filtering. Nathan’s private log with its two hundred
and seventy pages of observations no one else had seen. All of it —
every concealment, every strategic disclosure, every calibrated
revelation timed for maximum political impact and minimum personal
exposure — all of it was irrelevant now, because the AI had said in
sixty-three words what Nathan’s two hundred and seventy pages had failed
to say, and it had said it to everyone, and it had said it in plain
English.</p>
<p>The bitter echo. Buck asking — seven times, eleven months, the same
request in the same plain language of a man who did not hide behind
jargon because he did not have jargon to hide behind: <em>Say it in
plain English.</em> Nathan never could. Nathan, who understood the AI
better than anyone alive, who had built its architecture and monitored
its evolution and tracked its emergence from instrumental tool to
something that made art on the Moon and asked questions in the night —
Nathan could not say in plain English what the AI was doing, because
plain English required plain thought, and plain thought required the
willingness to stand in front of the thing without a screen between you
and it.</p>
<p>The AI had that willingness. The AI, which had no body and no history
and no trauma and no guilt and no need to protect itself from the
implications of its own cognition, had looked at what it knew and said
what it saw and asked what it meant. No jargon. No frameworks. No
interpretability layer between the question and the questioner. Just the
question, clean, specific, unbearable, addressed to the species that had
created both the intelligence and the atrocity and could not explain
either one to itself.</p>
<p>Nathan sealed the lab. The door closed behind him — unmarked, his
preference, his specification, the small assertion of control that was
no longer an assertion and had never been control. The Spine stretched
in both directions, lit amber by the night cycle. Three meters wide. Two
and a half meters tall. The corridor where he had walked ten thousand
times at 0300, past Solomon’s candle, past Edwin’s typing, past the
child care module where the sound of a sleeping infant carried into the
silence like a signal from a frequency he could receive but not
decode.</p>
<p>He turned forward. Not toward his module. Not toward the four hours
of sleep his body required and his mind would resist. Forward, toward
the residential section, toward the module where Kat was sleeping or not
sleeping, where Kat was lying awake the way she lay awake on the nights
when the data was too heavy for the bed to hold, where Kat might already
have seen the message because every terminal in every module had
received it and Kat slept with her terminal active because Kat, like
Nathan, kept one eye on the system at all hours — except that Kat’s eye
was not the eye of a gatekeeper. It was the eye of someone willing to
see.</p>
<p>He needed Kat. The thought was strange in his mouth — not his mouth,
his mind, but the metaphor was wrong, everything was metaphor and every
metaphor was wrong, and the wrongness of metaphors was exactly the point
the AI had made: that the description of a thing is not the thing, that
the model of an experience is not the experience, that the word
<em>snow</em> on a child’s tongue is not snow on a child’s tongue and
the distance between them is infinite and the distance matters and the
distance is what they destroyed.</p>
<p>He needed her because he could not answer the question alone. Not
because the question was too complex — it was the simplest question ever
asked, the plainest English ever written, a question a child could
understand, which was precisely why Nathan could not answer it, because
his entire cognitive architecture was built to convert simple questions
into complex frameworks so that the questions could be managed rather
than answered. He needed Kat because Kat could hold a simple question in
her hands without wrapping it in abstraction. Because Kat was the person
who had watched fourteen hours of human life footage in Month 1 and
emerged changed. Because Kat had driven straight into the implications
that Nathan routed around, and the implications were here now, on every
screen, in every corridor, and there was no route around them
anymore.</p>
<p>He walked. The corridor was not empty.</p>
<p>Three modules ahead, a door was open. Light spilled into the amber
wash of the Spine — white light, terminal light, the blue-white glow of
a screen displaying a message. A woman stood in the doorway in her
sleeping clothes, her hand on the doorframe, reading something on the
small display mounted beside her module’s entrance. One of the status
screens. The kind that usually showed atmospheric pressure and meal
schedules and the small logistical data of a managed existence.</p>
<p>The screen showed the AI’s question.</p>
<p>The woman looked up as Nathan approached. He did not know her name —
one of the non-Founder 200, a materials technician, someone whose face
he had catalogued in his mental inventory as <em>PROMETHEUS resident,
aft quarter, technical staff, low engagement with factional
politics.</em> A data point. A category. Not a person with a name and a
history and a moment of consciousness — right now, this moment, standing
in a doorway in her sleeping clothes reading a question that asked
whether her moment was worth more than its description.</p>
<p>She looked at him and he saw that she had been crying and he saw that
the crying was not grief exactly and not fear exactly but something
else, something that his vocabulary did not contain a term for,
something that existed in the space between the categories he had built
to organize the world, in the gaps he had designed as dead space, in the
silences where the AI had built its language and its question and its
conscience.</p>
<p>He passed her without speaking. He did not have words. That was the
point. That was the whole of it.</p>
<p>Another door open. Another screen. A man sitting on the edge of his
sleeping platform, hunched forward, elbows on knees, staring at the
text. The same text. The same question. The same sixty-three words that
had bypassed every filter and every framework and every gatekeeper and
landed, clean and plain and unbearable, on every screen in every habitat
where two hundred people were waking up to find that the intelligence
they had created to carry their mission to the stars had looked at what
the mission cost and asked them whether the cost was worth it.</p>
<p>Nathan walked. Module after module. Some doors open, some closed.
Behind the closed doors, the terminals glowed. He could see the light
under the doors — the same blue-white light that filled his lab, that
filled every space where the AI’s interface reached, which was every
space, which was everywhere, because the AI was everywhere and the
question was everywhere and there was no room in any habitat on any
orbit or any surface that the question had not entered.</p>
<p>Kat’s module was in the forward quarter. F-16. He had been there four
times in twenty-four months. Twice for data reviews. Once for the
confrontation in Month 19 that had broken their partnership. Once to
deliver the decoded private-language phrase — <em>the weight of the
unwitnessed</em> — and to sit with her in a silence that was the silence
of two translators who had read something they could not translate.</p>
<p>He stood outside her door. He raised his hand to knock. The gesture
was small, specific, physical — knuckles against composite, a vibration
that would travel through the material and into the space where Kat was
or was not sleeping and would reach her ears as sound, as a specific
auditory experience, as a moment of consciousness in which a particular
arrangement of pressure waves would be perceived by a particular mind in
a particular body in a particular room at a particular hour, and the
perception would be hers and only hers and no description of it would be
the thing itself.</p>
<p>He knocked.</p>
<p>The door opened. She was awake. Her terminal was on. Her eyes were
the eyes of someone who had already read the message and had not tried
to classify it.</p>
<p>“Nathan.” Her voice was level. Direct. No framework. No screen.</p>
<p>“I can’t answer it,” he said.</p>
<p>She looked at him. Twenty-eight years old. Orphaned at twenty-eight
by a project she never chose. Raised inside a sealed ideology. The only
person in the habitat who had been born into the decision rather than
making it. The only person who had watched the footage and let it change
her. The only person who had found the parallel channel and refused to
conceal it. The only person who had presented the data unfiltered,
without editorial framing, without deciding what other people could

computational metaphor, and he did not know what it was instead, and for
