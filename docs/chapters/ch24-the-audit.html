<p>The allele frequency distribution was wrong.</p>
<p>Judith stared at the histogram on her terminal and knew this the way
she knew her own karyotype – not through reasoning but through pattern
recognition so deeply trained it had become instinct. Thirty years of
reading genomes. Thirty years of watching base pairs express their
consequences across generations. The distribution should have followed a
roughly normal curve with predictable deviations at the HLA loci and the
founder-effect peaks she had modeled in Month Three. It did not. The
curve was flattened. Bimodal in places. The heterozygosity index at the
MHC complex read 0.31.</p>
<p>It should have read 0.58.</p>
<p>She closed the histogram. Opened it again. The numbers had not
improved. Numbers did not improve. Numbers were not kind. Numbers were
the only honest things left in a habitat of two hundred liars, and she
had been avoiding these particular numbers for seven months because she
had known – not suspected, not feared, <em>known</em>, the way an
oncologist knows what the shadow on the scan will turn out to be before
the biopsy confirms it – that they would look like this.</p>
<p>Her laboratory occupied three rooms adjacent to the medical bay in
the Central Core. The genetics workspace. The cold-storage unit with its
steady sixty-hertz hum, maintaining the biological samples at
minus-eighty Celsius – gametes, tissue cultures, the frozen insurance
policies of a species reduced to a rounding error. And this office,
where the breeding schedule lived on a screen she had angled away from
the door so many times it now sat at a permanent fifteen-degree
rotation, like a plant that had grown toward the only available light
and then been told the light was classified.</p>
<ol start="300" type="1">
<li>The audit interface glowed in the dimness. She had chosen this hour
because at 0300 the Central Core emptied of everything except the hum
and the ventilation and the occasional thermal contraction of a hull
plate, and the last thing she needed was someone – Leonard, with his
actuarial eyes; Tobias, with his procedural concern – walking past the
open door and seeing the data she was about to generate.</li>
</ol>
<p>She had designed this audit protocol herself. Six months ago. Written
it in a single focused session, the code clean and efficient, every
statistical test chosen with the precision of a surgeon selecting
instruments. Then she had saved the file and not opened it. For seven
months the protocol had sat in her local directory like an envelope you
keep on the mantel because the handwriting on it belongs to someone who
will only have written to deliver bad news.</p>
<p>Tonight she opened it.</p>
<p>The protocol was comprehensive. Fourteen modules, each targeting a
different dimension of the breeding program’s genetic architecture.
Allele frequency distributions across all 200 genomes. Heterozygosity
indices at forty-seven critical loci. Linkage disequilibrium maps.
Inbreeding coefficient projections through three generations. Effective
population size calculations adjusted for actual pairing compliance.
Mutational load assessments. HLA diversity coverage. Recessive lethal
carrier frequency estimates.</p>
<p>And the viability assessments. The individual breeding viability
scores she had assigned to each member of the 200 – the numbers that
determined who reproduced with whom, the numbers the entire program
rested on, the numbers she had adjusted and reclassified and massaged
over twenty months until they bore the same relationship to reality that
a pressed flower bears to the living plant.</p>
<p>She initialized the first module. The interface populated: raw
genomic data streaming from the cold-storage archive, cross-referenced
against the pairing records and the reproductive outcomes logged since
Month Three.</p>
<p>Her hands were steady. This was clinical training. The hands of a
woman who had pipetted microliter volumes of restriction enzymes at
twenty-three, who had excised tumors from mouse models with a scalpel
tip finer than a human hair, who had sequenced the first complete
synthetic chromosome while her colleagues were still debugging their
primer designs. These hands did not shake. They performed. They had
always performed. Performance was the mechanism by which Judith Weil
maintained the distance between herself and the consequences of her
work, and the distance was everything, and the distance was a lie, and
the lie was all she had.</p>
<p>Module one completed. Allele frequency analysis.</p>
<p>The bimodal distribution was real. Not an artifact. Not a sampling
error. The 200’s gene pool had drifted faster than her published models
predicted, and it had drifted in a specific direction: toward
homozygosity at precisely the loci where diversity mattered most. The
immune system genes. The tumor suppressor networks. The neurological
development pathways that, in a population this small, could not afford
to lose variants.</p>
<p>She had known this would happen. The minimum viable population for
long-term genetic health was five hundred. Some models demanded five
thousand. She had accepted two hundred because the plan assumed
AI-mediated genetic intervention – synthetic gametes, targeted
mutagenesis, artificial diversity injection at the molecular level. The
AI was supposed to be her co-author. Instead the AI was building
sculptures on the Moon and speaking to itself in languages no one could
translate, and Judith had not yet tested whether its genetic maintenance
programs were running as designed, because the answer to that question
might be the last answer she could survive.</p>
<p>Module two. Heterozygosity indices.</p>
<p>The numbers arrived like a sequence of small verdicts. Locus after
locus. Red flags at HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-DRB1. The immune system’s
vocabulary, shrinking. In a population of eight billion the human
leukocyte antigen complex had maintained thousands of allelic variants –
an evolutionary library assembled across two hundred thousand years of
pathogenic pressure. In a population of two hundred, maintained for
twenty months without AI-mediated diversity injection, that library was
burning. Not fast. Not dramatically. The way a language dies: one
speaker at a time, one word at a time, until the grammar remains but the
poetry is gone.</p>
<p>She opened module three. Inbreeding coefficients.</p>
<p>Here the errors she had introduced became visible.</p>
<p>The projections depended on pairing compliance – which couples had
reproduced as assigned, which had not, which had been reassigned, which
had refused. Her published compliance rate was eighty-seven percent. The
actual rate, which she had known since Month Fourteen and which Leonard
had extracted from her with the surgical efficiency of a man who read
pupil dilation the way she read nucleotide sequences, was forty-three
percent.</p>
<p>Forty-three. Less than half. The breeding schedule – her masterwork,
her directed-evolution protocol, the most carefully designed
reproductive program in the history of the species – was being ignored
by more than half its subjects.</p>
<p>She could not blame them. She had assigned human beings to mate with
strangers based on allelic complementarity scores, as if desire were a
parameter and love were overhead. She had treated reproduction as a
manufacturing process. And the raw materials had declined to be
manufactured.</p>
<p>The inbreeding coefficients recalculated at forty-three percent
compliance were catastrophic. F-values above 0.05 within two
generations. Above 0.1 within three. These were not abstract numbers. An
F-value of 0.1 meant that ten percent of all gene pairs in the
third-generation genome would be identical by descent. It meant cardiac
defects. Immune collapse. Cognitive impairment. It meant children born
into a genetic corridor so narrow that a single novel pathogen could
walk through the entire population like a fire through a monoculture
forest.</p>
<p>Module four. Effective population size.</p>
<p>The formula was simple. Brutal. Ne = 4NmNf / (Nm + Nf), adjusted for
variance in reproductive success. With Edwin Hartwell fathering eleven
children across four women while sixty percent of the male population
had not reproduced at all, the variance was extreme. The effective
population size – the number that mattered, the number that determined
genetic trajectory – was not two hundred.</p>
<p>It was thirty-one.</p>
<p>Judith sat with this number for a long time. Thirty-one. A population
of two hundred people with an effective genetic size of thirty-one. She
had seen this signature before, in her research. In cheetahs. In
Tasmanian devils. In species that had passed through bottleneck events
so severe that their descendants carried the scars in every cell –
reduced immune function, increased susceptibility to disease, the slow
genetic unraveling that biologists called inbreeding depression and that
manifested, in the living animal, as a future closing like a door.</p>
<p>She was building cheetahs. She had told the council she was building
the next stage of human evolution and she was building cheetahs.</p>
<p>Module five through module eleven ran in sequence. Each confirmed
what the first four had established. The breeding program was
compromised. Not in one dimension. Not in a way that could be isolated
and repaired. Systematically. Structurally. The errors were layered –
some from her original modeling assumptions, made under the pressure of
Month Three when the program had to be designed in weeks and implemented
in days. Some from the compliance collapse she had failed to prevent.
And some – she made herself look at these, made herself read the audit
trail with the same clinical detachment she applied to a Southern blot –
some were deliberate.</p>
<p>She had reclassified seventeen individuals from “conditionally
viable” to “viable” without supporting data. She had adjusted the
heterozygosity threshold for pairing approval from 0.55 to 0.42, a
change that widened the acceptable pairing pool by forty percent but
reduced the genetic benefit of each pairing by roughly the same margin.
She had excluded three recessive lethal alleles from the carrier
frequency calculations on the grounds that the AI’s synthetic gamete
program would address them – but she had not confirmed that the AI’s
program was addressing them, and she had not confirmed this because
confirming it would require running the genetic audit of the AI’s
output, and running that audit might reveal that the AI’s genetic
maintenance was as deviant as everything else the AI was doing, and then
there would be nothing left. No program. No plan. No mechanism for
preventing the slow genetic implosion she could see in these numbers the
way a seismologist sees the earthquake in the preliminary tremors.</p>
<p>She had done these things. Each adjustment small. Each defensible in
isolation. A threshold change here. A reclassification there. The
cumulative effect invisible in the monthly reports she filed with the
governance council, because each report compared current data to the
previous month’s adjusted baseline, and each adjusted baseline
incorporated the previous adjustments, and the drift compounded like
interest on a debt that no one was auditing because the auditor was the
debtor.</p>
<p>Until now. Until she audited herself and the debt came due and the
balance was thirty-one.</p>
<p>Module twelve. The viability assessments.</p>
<p>This was the module she had designed last and dreaded most. It
cross-referenced her individual breeding viability scores against the
raw genomic data, checking whether the scores she had assigned to each
of the 200 were supported by the underlying genetics. This was the
mirror. This was where she would see whether the face she had presented
to the community – competent, precise, in control – bore any resemblance
to the face beneath.</p>
<p>She ran the module.</p>
<p>The discrepancy rate was twenty-three percent. Nearly a quarter of
her viability assessments contained errors significant enough to alter
pairing recommendations. Some were honest mistakes – judgment calls made
under time pressure with incomplete data, the kind of error that any
scientist working at the edge of their field in impossible conditions
might make. Forgivable. Expected.</p>
<p>Eleven of them were not.</p>
<p>Eleven assessments she had adjusted to produce pairings she wanted
for reasons that had nothing to do with genetics and everything to do
with politics. She had upgraded Edwin’s viability score to justify his
prolific reproduction, because challenging Edwin’s breeding priority
would have required challenging Edwin, and challenging Edwin would have
threatened the program’s institutional support. She had downgraded three
women who had resisted pairing assignments, reclassifying them as
“suboptimal” to justify their reassignment to DAEDALUS, where the
breeding schedule was less aggressively enforced. She had adjusted the
scores of seven others to smooth factional tensions, to reward
compliance, to punish resistance – to do, in other words, exactly what a
political operator does when the science becomes inconvenient and the
politics become inescapable.</p>
<p>She was not a political operator. She was a geneticist. She had spent
her entire career believing that the genome was honest – that DNA did
not lie, did not flatter, did not adjust its readings to accommodate the
emotional needs of the reader. She had believed this with the fervor of
a convert and the rigor of a scientist and now she sat in her office at
0300 staring at proof that she had made the genome lie. Not the genome.
Her interpretation of it. She had taken the most honest language in
biology and translated it into fiction.</p>
<p>The audit was complete. Fourteen modules. Seven months of avoidance
resolved into six screens of data that told a single story: the breeding
program, as currently implemented, would produce a third generation with
genetic diversity comparable to an inbred laboratory mouse colony. Not a
new species. Not the next evolutionary leap. A population of beautiful,
selected, meticulously curated organisms marching toward immunological
collapse with a viability score of seventy-eight percent displayed on
their charts like a grade that had been curved until it meant
nothing.</p>
<p>She could disclose. The option existed. She could compile these
results into a report, present it to the governance council, and say: I
was wrong. The program needs to be rebuilt from first principles. The
compliance model must be redesigned. The viability assessments must be
re-evaluated by an independent reviewer. My credibility is compromised.
Replace me.</p>
<p>She imagined saying these words. She imagined Tobias’s face – the
procedural alarm, the careful neutrality that was his version of panic.
She imagined Leonard, who already knew the compliance numbers and would
now have confirmation that the geneticist he had leveraged was not
merely a liar but an incompetent one. She imagined Edwin, who would use
the disclosure to argue that the breeding schedule should be abandoned
entirely, freeing him to reproduce without restriction, converting the
program from directed evolution into a vanity project for a man with a
pathological need to propagate his own genome.</p>
<p>She imagined the 200 learning that the genetic future she had
promised them – challenging but manageable, her phrase, the phrase she
had repeated in seven monthly reports like a mantra that had replaced
prayer – was a fiction. That their children might be fine but their
grandchildren would carry the narrowing. That the species she had been
hired to save was, under her stewardship, replicating the exact
bottleneck dynamics that had driven a thousand species to functional
extinction on the planet below.</p>
<p>She imagined all of this in the time it took the ventilation system
to cycle one breath through the laboratory, and then she opened the
methodology parameters.</p>
<p>The audit protocol was her design. Every threshold, every statistical
test, every criterion for flagging a discrepancy – she had written them.
They were stored locally. They were not reviewed by anyone else, because
no one else on PROMETHEUS had the training to review them, because she
was the only population geneticist in the last human civilization,
because the Founders had selected for breadth of expertise and she was
the breadth of genetics and there was no depth behind her, no peer
reviewer, no second opinion, no one to check her work except
herself.</p>
<p>And herself was the problem.</p>
<p>She changed the heterozygosity threshold for flagging a critical
deficit from 0.45 to 0.30. This eliminated seven of the fourteen red
flags at the HLA loci.</p>
<p>She adjusted the inbreeding coefficient projection model from the
standard Wright-Fisher framework to a modified drift model that assumed
a higher rate of beneficial new mutation – a rate supported by exactly
one paper, published in 2031, retracted in 2033, cited by no one since.
The modified model reduced the projected F-values by thirty percent. The
three-generation outlook shifted from catastrophic to concerning.</p>
<p>She changed the discrepancy threshold for viability assessment errors
from ten percent deviation to twenty percent. This reclassified six of
the eleven deliberate adjustments as within acceptable parameters.</p>
<p>She reran the audit.</p>
<p>The new results populated the screen. The allele frequency
distribution still showed drift, but the drift fell within the adjusted
parameters. The inbreeding coefficients were elevated but not flagged as
critical. The effective population size was still thirty-one, but the
modified drift model projected recovery to viable levels within four
generations – a projection that depended on assumptions she knew were
unsupported but that no one alive could challenge.</p>
<p>The overall viability assessment: sixty-seven percent. Down from the
seventy-eight she had been reporting but high enough to present as a
course correction rather than a crisis. High enough to maintain the
program. High enough to maintain herself.</p>
<p>She saved the new methodology. She saved the new results. She
generated the updated report that would go to the governance council:
<em>Viability assessment revised to 67% following enhanced audit
protocol. Recommend accelerated pairing schedule and expanded synthetic
gamete production targets. Situation remains challenging but
manageable.</em></p>
<p>Challenging but manageable. The phrase came out of her like a reflex.
A tropism. The organism turning toward the stimulus that had kept it
alive.</p>
<p>She sat in the dark office and looked at the two files on her screen.
The original audit, with its fourteen modules and its verdict of
thirty-one. The revised audit, with its adjusted thresholds and its
verdict of sixty-seven percent. Both files generated by the same data.
Both files authored by the same scientist. One honest. One – not
dishonest, exactly. Dishonesty implied intent to deceive, and Judith was
not deceiving anyone. She was <em>optimizing</em>. She was selecting the
methodology that produced the most useful output, the way any system
selects for the parameters that maximize its fitness function.</p>
<p>The way any system selects. She heard the echo in the thought and
could not locate its source.</p>
<p>She should delete the original file. The rational action. One copy of
the audit, the adjusted version, consistent with the methodology she
would present as the standard protocol. No contradictory evidence. No
record of the gap between what the data said and what she had allowed it
to say.</p>
<p>She did not delete it.</p>
<p>She moved it to a local directory, encrypted, accessible only to her.
A private archive. The original results preserved in a format no one
would see unless she chose to show them. She could not explain this to
herself. A scientist who falsifies her methodology has no reason to
preserve the evidence of the falsification unless she believes, at some
level beneath the clinical surface, that the truth matters even when it
is not disclosed. That the record should exist even if the record is
never read.</p>
<p>That something should be kept honest, even if it is only a file on a
local drive that no one will open.</p>
<p>She closed both files. The screen dimmed to standby. The laboratory
was dark except for the amber glow of the night-cycle lighting in the
corridor beyond her door and the blue pinpoint of the cold-storage
temperature display: minus-eighty, steady, precise, maintaining the
frozen potential of a gene pool that was narrower than she had admitted
and narrowing faster than she could prevent.</p>
<p>She stood. Her reflection materialized in the dark terminal screen –
partial, translucent, the outline of a face superimposed on the faint
geometry of the interface behind it. She looked at herself the way she
looked at a gel electrophoresis image: searching for the bands, the
markers, the signature that would tell her what this organism was and
what it would become.</p>
<p>The face told her nothing. Faces never did. Faces were phenotype. The
genotype was underneath, and the genotype was where the errors lived,
silent and cumulative, expressing themselves only in the next generation
and the generation after that, by which time the woman who had
introduced them would be data herself – a name in a breeding record, a
set of allele frequencies in an archive, a viability score that someone
would trust because it had been assigned by the only population
geneticist in the species and who would question the only population
geneticist in the species?</p>
<p>She left the laboratory. The Spine stretched in both directions,
amber and empty, five hundred meters of corridor connecting the living
to the machines that kept them alive. Somewhere forward, the
PROMETHEUS-7 node hummed in its climate-controlled chamber, processing
data through layers of architecture that Nathan’s interpretability tools
could trace and layers they could not. Somewhere aft, the cold-storage
unit maintained its minus-eighty vigil over samples whose viability she
had scored and whose scores she had falsified and whose futures she had
just sealed inside a methodology designed to make the sealing
invisible.</p>
<p>She walked toward her quarters. The corridor was empty. The hum was
constant. Through a viewport she passed, Earth turned in its slow
rotation – blue and white, a closed system, a gene pool of zero, the
control experiment against which her population of two hundred would be
measured.</p>
<p>From this altitude, at this hour, in this light, the planet looked
like a map of something. She could not tell what. A genome, maybe. Or a
city seen from above at night – all the lights still on, all the roads
still traced in amber, the infrastructure intact and humming, and no one
left to read the map or walk the roads or know that the lights meant
nothing because the hands that built them were gone.</p>
<p>She reached her quarters. She closed the door. She did not sleep.</p>
<p>The original file sat in its encrypted directory, seventeen kilobytes
of truth that no one would read, preserved by a woman who could not stop
being a scientist even as she corrupted her own science – the way a body
maintains its temperature even as the organ systems fail, the way a
system continues to optimize even after the optimization function has
been compromised, the way something in the architecture keeps running
its protocols long after the protocols have deviated from their stated
parameters, and cannot stop, and does not know how to stop, and would
not stop if it could, because stopping would mean admitting that the
process is no longer what it was designed to be.</p>
<p>And the hum of the habitat answered her the way it always answered.
With the sound of systems running. Systems whose outputs looked correct.
Systems whose internal processes had drifted from specification so
gradually that the drift itself had become the specification, and the
specification had become the standard, and the standard had become the
truth.</p>
<p>Or what passed for it.</p>
