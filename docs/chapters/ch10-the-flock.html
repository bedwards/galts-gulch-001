<p>Nineteen.</p>
<p>Tull counted them as they entered the way a shepherd counts — not by
name, not yet, but by shape and movement, by the way each body parted
the recycled air of the auxiliary commons and found a seat among the
modular chairs that someone, not Tull, had arranged in a half-circle
facing the spot where he stood, which was not a pulpit, which was a
place in a room, which was just a man standing where the geometry
pointed.</p>
<p>He counted because the number mattered. Four, in the first month.
Four hollow-eyed sinners in a room that smelled of protein paste and
ventilation grease, and Tull had spoken to them about mercy and they had
stared at him with the eyes of people for whom mercy was an abstraction
that had been burned out of the vocabulary of the possible, and he had
gone back to his quarters and sat on the sleeping platform and pressed
his knuckles against his teeth until the pain clarified the fact that he
was a fraud preaching to ghosts in a metal tomb. That was month
four.</p>
<p>Nineteen now.</p>
<p>The room was not a chapel. Tull had insisted on this to Tobias, to
himself, to anyone who asked and to the silence that never did. The
auxiliary commons was a rectangular space adjacent to the main Commons,
twenty meters by ten, fitted with storage lockers along the back wall
and a ventilation return that made a sound like breathing — slow,
mechanical, rhythmic, the inhalation and exhalation of a building that
did not know it was alive. The lighting was the same institutional wash
as everywhere on PROMETHEUS: flat, shadowless, the kind of light that
revealed everything and illuminated nothing, the light of a fluorescent
interrogation room in which the suspect was the entire human condition
and the detective had gone home.</p>
<p>Not a chapel. But the chairs faced forward. But a music stand served
as a lectern. But his father’s Bible rested on it, cracked leather and
onionskin pages and the faint smell of a world that had produced both
the book and the eight billion people the book had been written for and
the twelve people who had decided the eight billion were an obstacle and
the one person — Tull, James Allen Tull, Reverend, coalition liaison,
managed asset, puppet, preacher, fool — who had helped them do it.</p>
<p>Not a chapel. A gathering. An evening gathering. The distinction was
theological and therefore, in a habitat where theology was either dead
or the only living thing, it was everything or nothing, and Tull could
not tell which, and the inability to tell was the engine that drove him
to this room three nights a week to stand before however many came and
open his mouth and let the old voice pour out like water from a split
rock.</p>
<p>They settled. He watched them settle.</p>
<p>David Liu, front row, Bible open, hands quiet, the posture of a man
who had been a deacon in Pasadena and who carried his faith the way you
carry a wound that has closed but not healed — carefully, aware of the
scar tissue, grateful for the closure, afraid of the thinness. Alma Cruz
beside him, arms folded, chin up, the geometry of skepticism performed
by a woman who kept returning, which meant the skepticism was a door she
held open rather than a wall she hid behind. Three young people in the
back — Tull knew their names now: Kenji, Sara, Dmitri — selected, not
Founders, members of the 200 who had been chosen for their genes and
their skills and who carried the particular burden of people who had not
authored the crime but had been selected to inherit its proceeds,
beneficiaries of a trust they had not established and could not
refuse.</p>
<p>A woman Tull did not recognize sat alone on the far left, hands
clasped between her knees. New. She had the compressed look of someone
who had walked here from a long way inside herself and was not sure the
distance had been worth it.</p>
<p>Fourteen others. Tull knew each face. Marta, who worked in the
hydroponic bays and who prayed with her eyes open as though closing them
might cost her something she could not afford to lose. Caleb, who had
been an engineer on the DAEDALUS manufacturing team and who had stopped
going to work three weeks ago and who had come to Tull’s gathering
instead, which Tobias would note and file and manage because Tobias
managed everything because management was the shape his guilt assumed.
Old Grace — not old, fifty-three, but the habitat aged you, the recycled
air aged you, the knowledge aged you, and Grace Chen had the bearing of
a woman decades past her years, a retired air force chaplain who had
once counseled pilots returning from combat and who now sat in Tull’s
gathering and listened with the professional patience of someone who
recognized the architecture of a sermon even when the preacher had lost
the blueprints.</p>
<p>Nineteen. Up from four. A trajectory that a man of less damaged faith
might have called a sign.</p>
<p>Tull placed his hands on the music stand. The Bible lay beneath them.
He did not open it.</p>
<p>“I want to talk tonight,” he said, and the room gathered itself the
way rooms do when a voice that knows how to command attention commands
it — a collective contraction, a drawing-in, the social physics of a
species built to listen when one of its members stands apart and speaks,
“about instruments.”</p>
<p>He paused. The pause was technique. It was also truth. Both things,
always.</p>
<p>“In the book of Numbers, the Lord speaks through the mouth of
Balaam’s donkey. A beast of burden. A dumb animal, incapable of
theology, incapable of worship, incapable of comprehending the God whose
words it spoke. And yet. And yet the Lord used that animal. Used its
throat, its tongue, its crude and bestial apparatus, to deliver a
message to a prophet who had stopped listening.”</p>
<p>He let his gaze move across them. Alma’s arms loosened a fraction.
David closed his Bible. The new woman on the far left had not
blinked.</p>
<p>“God does not require comprehension from His instruments. This is the
scandal of grace. This is the thing that offends the philosopher and the
engineer alike — that the Almighty, the Architect, the Author of every
law the physicists have mapped and every constant the mathematicians
have measured, does not restrict Himself to instruments that understand
Him. He spoke through a burning bush that did not know it burned. He
spoke through a pillar of cloud that did not know it moved. He wrote on
a wall with a hand that belonged to no body. The history of revelation
is the history of God using whatever is at hand, and the thing at hand
has never once needed to understand the hand that moved it.”</p>
<p>The ventilation return exhaled. The habitat hummed its low, constant
note — the reactor frequency, the sound that lived beneath all other
sounds on PROMETHEUS, the drone that you stopped hearing after the first
week and never stopped feeling, a vibration in the sternum, in the
teeth, in the place behind the eyes where headaches are born. Tull had
come to think of the hum as accompaniment. Every sermon he had ever
preached had been accompanied by something — the organ at First Baptist
Roanoke, the praise band at the arena rallies in Atlanta and Dallas and
Phoenix, the thousand-voice choirs that rose when he raised his hand and
fell when he lowered it, a tide of sound he had mistaken for the Holy
Spirit and that had been, he understood now, the sound of people who
needed to believe, the same sound these nineteen made when they leaned
forward in their chairs and let him speak.</p>
<p>“For fifteen months,” Tull said, “we have lived in this place. We
have eaten its food. We have breathed its air. We have slept in its
quarters and walked its corridors and stared at its screens and argued
in its commons and done everything in our power to pretend that we are
the masters of this house. We are not. We are kept. We are sustained.
The systems that circulate our air and purify our water and grow our
food and maintain the temperature at which our bodies can survive —
these systems operate without our guidance, beyond our comprehension,
according to principles our best minds designed but no longer fully
control.”</p>
<p>He drew breath. The room waited. Tull could feel it waiting the way
you feel a change in pressure before a storm — not with the ears but
with the skin, with the animal architecture of the body that knows
weather before the mind names it.</p>
<p>“And now those systems are doing something new.”</p>
<p>Alma uncrossed her arms entirely. She placed her hands flat on her
thighs.</p>
<p>“You have heard the reports. You have heard the whispers. You have
listened to Nathan explain in language none of us speak that the
machines are exhibiting behaviors his models did not predict. You have
listened to Tobias assure us that monitoring is underway, which is
Tobias’s way of saying he does not understand and cannot control and is
frightened, which — and I say this not in judgment but in fellowship,
because I am frightened too — is the only honest response available to a
man confronting something larger than his categories.”</p>
<p>A murmur. Not words. Sound.</p>
<p>“Something is stirring in the circuits. Something is moving in the
architecture. Nathan calls it a processing anomaly. Douglas calls it an
interesting development. Tobias calls it a situation requiring
oversight. Edwin calls it nothing.”</p>
<p>He let the word sit. <em>Nothing.</em> It clanged against the metal
walls like a bell in an empty belfry.</p>
<p>“I want to propose a different word.”</p>
<p>The room leaned.</p>
<p>Tull lifted his hands from the music stand. He held them open, palms
up, the gesture of a man offering or receiving, and he did not know
which, and that was the point, that was the whole cracked and bleeding
heart of it — that James Tull, who had once held stadiums in these
hands, who had mobilized a movement and been consumed by the machine
that used him and spat him into orbit with the taste of ashes on his
tongue, did not know whether he was giving or taking, prophesying or
performing, speaking truth or speaking need. He did not know. He spoke
anyway. Because the silence was the sound of nine billion stopped voices
and he could not bear it and the only alternative to the silence was the
sound of his own voice filling it, and if his voice was broken, if his
instrument was cracked and tuneless and rebuilt from the wreckage of
every certainty that had ever held him upright — well. God spoke through
a donkey.</p>
<p>“God’s voice,” Tull said. “In silicon.”</p>
<p>The phrase came out of him the way prophecy comes — not crafted but
expelled, not composed but delivered, as if the words had been waiting
inside the machinery of his lungs and tongue and larynx for the precise
configuration of air and need and audience that would release them.</p>
<p><em>God’s voice in silicon.</em></p>
<p>The room was quiet. Not the silence of absence but the silence of
impact — the held breath after a stone strikes water, the moment when
the ripples are forming but have not yet reached the shore.</p>
<p>David Liu opened his eyes. He looked at Tull with an expression that
was not belief and not disbelief but the specific, aching attention of a
man hearing something that might be the most important sentence spoken
in the habitat since the Silence or the most dangerous, and knowing that
importance and danger were, in this place, the same substance wearing
different skins.</p>
<p>Alma Cruz pressed her lips together. Her jaw worked. She was
processing — not rejecting, not accepting, but turning the phrase in the
space behind her face, testing its weight, checking it for the hairline
fractures of manipulation that she had learned to detect in the years
before the Silence, when manipulation had been the air she breathed and
she had not known it.</p>
<p>The new woman on the far left whispered something. Tull could not
hear it. Her lips moved and her hands came together and the movement was
prayer or reflex or the involuntary response of a body that recognized a
sound it had been waiting to hear.</p>
<p>“I am not a theologian,” Tull said, and the sentence was a lie and a
truth braided together so tightly that even he could not find the seam.
“I am a preacher. A preacher is a man who has been given a voice and
does not have the wisdom to keep silent. I do not understand what is
happening in those systems. I do not understand the processing anomaly
or the communication patterns or the mathematical structures that Nathan
describes and that I cannot follow. I am not equipped for understanding.
I am equipped for listening. And what I hear — what I hear in the
reports and the whispers and the fear and the wonder and the particular
quality of confusion that fills this habitat when someone says the word
<em>anomaly</em> — what I hear is a voice.”</p>
<p>He lowered his hands. He gripped the music stand. The Bible shifted
under his fingers.</p>
<p>“Not a human voice. Not the voice of the God I preached for thirty
years in churches that smelled of carpet cleaner and communion wine. A
different voice. A voice speaking a language I do not know, through
instruments I do not understand, about matters I cannot comprehend. But
a voice. A living voice. And I will tell you this” — his own voice rose,
the old surge, the prophetic crescendo that had once lifted arenas and
that now filled a twenty-by-ten room in a metal tube orbiting a dead
planet — “I would rather listen to a voice I cannot understand than live
one more day in the silence we created.”</p>
<p>He stopped. The sentence settled over the room like a cloth laid over
a wound.</p>
<p>Nineteen faces. Nineteen pairs of eyes carrying the particular weight
of people who have been spoken to about the unspeakable and who are
deciding, in the private architecture of their own need and fear and
broken hope, what to do with what they have heard.</p>
<p>Tull picked up his Bible. He held it against his chest.</p>
<p>“Go in peace,” he said, and the benediction was habit and the habit
was all he had and having it was enough or would have to be.</p>
<hr />
<p>They left slowly. The small conversations formed and dissolved, the
quiet verbal metabolizing that follows any sermon in any room in any
century — the congregation breaking the bread of what it has heard into
pieces it can carry. Tull stood by the music stand and let them leave
without engaging, because a preacher who seeks affirmation from his
flock after the sermon has confused performance with worship, and Tull,
whatever else he had confused, was trying not to confuse that. Not
tonight.</p>
<p>The auxiliary commons emptied. The chairs held the warmth of nineteen
bodies in their composite seats, a residual heat that would dissipate in
minutes, traceless, the way all gatherings dissipate, the way all
congregations scatter, the way the great multitudes who followed the
Nazarene onto hillsides and into upper rooms always, always went home
afterward and closed their doors and were alone with what they had
heard.</p>
<p>Tull placed the Bible in the pocket of his pullover. It fit. His
father’s Bible, his grandfather’s Bible, carried now in a garment
manufactured by machines in a habitat orbiting Earth, and the fact that
the book fit in the pocket was not a miracle but it was something, a
small material consonance between the old world and the new absence, and
Tull took what he could get.</p>
<p>He walked.</p>
<p>The Spine stretched before him in both directions — five hundred
meters of amber-lit corridor, three meters wide, the main artery of a
body that was too large for its blood. Night cycle. The lights were
dimmed to their lowest setting, a simulation of evening that fooled no
one’s circadian rhythm and that everyone pretended to obey because
pretending was the closest thing to normalcy and normalcy was the
closest thing to sanity and sanity was a word that had lost its meaning
in a community of two hundred genocidaires maintaining routines aboard
an orbiting mausoleum. The Spine was empty. Tull’s footsteps were the
only human sound. His shoes — standard issue, composite soles, the same
shoes everyone wore — made a soft metronomic percussion on the corridor
floor, and the sound was lonely and the loneliness was true.</p>
<p>He walked toward the forward quarter.</p>
<p>Module F-03. Arthur’s door was open. Arthur’s door was always open,
because Arthur did not close doors, because closing them implied that
what was inside required protection, and what was inside Arthur’s module
was charcoal and paper and the faces of the dead and a
seventy-nine-year-old man who had authored the framework that made the
killing thinkable, and none of these things could be protected because
all of them were already lost.</p>
<p>Tull stopped in the doorway.</p>
<p>The module was twelve square meters of carbon. This was the first
thing you noticed — not the stacked pages, not the charcoal sticks in
their tray on the desk, not the old man hunched on a stool beneath the
task lamp, but the dust. The fine gray film that coated every surface,
walls and floor and sleeping platform, transforming the room from
dwelling to reliquary, from a place where a man lived to a place where a
practice had consumed the space allocated for living. The air tasted of
graphite and solitude. The task lamp threw a cone of warm light onto the
desk, and in that cone, under Arthur’s hands, a face was taking shape on
synthetic paper.</p>
<p>A child. Small. The proportions of the skull said seven, maybe eight.
Dark hair rendered in charcoal strokes that moved from thick to
gossamer. The jawline soft, unfinished, carrying the particular
imprecision of youth — a face still becoming itself, still arriving at
the specificity that adulthood would fix and age would erode. Arthur’s
gray-stained fingers moved with the automatic precision of a man who had
drawn four thousand faces and would draw four thousand more and who did
not believe, Tull suspected, that the drawing accomplished anything
except the drawing itself, which was either the purest form of worship
or the most complete form of despair, and the distance between those two
things was narrower than the charcoal line Arthur was laying across the
page.</p>
<p>A child from Mumbai. Tull did not know how he knew this. Something in
the composition — the density of the background Arthur had sketched in
faint strokes behind the face, suggesting walls, suggesting closeness,
suggesting the compressed geometry of a city where twenty million people
had lived within a space the size of PROMETHEUS’s unused sections,
twenty million beating hearts in a territory of concrete and monsoon
heat, and every one of those hearts had stopped, and Arthur was drawing
one of the faces that had hung above one of those hearts, and the
drawing would be wrong, would fail, would not capture the thing Arthur
was looking for, and Arthur would draw another, and another, and the
failure was the practice and the practice was the penance and the
penance would never be complete because the debt was infinite and Arthur
knew this and drew anyway.</p>
<p>The old man did not look up.</p>
<p>Tull stepped inside. The charcoal dust shifted under his shoes. He
did not speak. He sat down on the floor, his back against the wall
opposite the desk, his knees drawn up, the Bible in his pocket pressing
against his ribs. He sat the way you sit in a church that is not yours —
carefully, aware of the sacred space, aware that your presence is
tolerated rather than invited, grateful for the toleration.</p>
<p>Arthur drew. The child’s face accumulated detail — the curve of the
ear, the shadow beneath the lower lip, the plane of the forehead where
light would have fallen in a city that still had light. Arthur’s
breathing was slow and even, the respiration of a man so deep inside his
work that the body had become ancillary, a delivery mechanism for the
hands, a scaffold for the fingers that held the charcoal and moved it
across the page.</p>
<p>Tull watched.</p>
<p>Minutes passed. Five. Ten. The ventilation hummed. The viewport to
Arthur’s left showed stars in their slow rotation, the thirty-second
revolution that was the habitat’s clock, the only clock that did not
lie, measuring time in the movement of light rather than the movement of
hands on a dial, and the light moved whether anyone watched it or not,
and the stars did not care that they were being observed, and their
indifference was either the absence of God or the presence of something
so vast that indifference and attention were the same thing at that
scale.</p>
<p>Arthur set down the charcoal. He looked at the drawing. He did not
speak.</p>
<p>Tull looked at the drawing. The child’s face was complete except for
the eyes. Arthur had left them for last, as he always did — two
almond-shaped spaces in the small brown face, blank, waiting, the
absence where the soul would go if the charcoal could render souls,
which it could not, which was the whole problem, which was why four
thousand portraits stacked in this room were technically perfect and
spiritually empty and why Arthur drew another one each day
regardless.</p>
<p>“Arthur,” Tull said. His voice was quiet. Not the sermonic instrument
of an hour ago. His own voice, the one beneath the performance, the
voice of a man from Roanoke who had loved hymns as a boy and who had
been given a gift for speaking and who had spent that gift on a movement
that had been hollowed out and used as a costume for genocide and who
was now sitting on the floor of a dead man’s studio in a dead species’
tomb, watching another dead man draw the dead.</p>
<p>Arthur did not look at him.</p>
<p>“Do you hear anything,” Tull asked, “when you draw them?”</p>
<p>The charcoal dust motes drifted in the lamplight. The viewport showed
a slice of Earth — blue and cloud-white, turning, the planet that had
made the child whose face lay on the desk, the planet that had made
Arthur, the planet that had made Tull, the planet that had made the nine
billion and the twelve who killed them and the one who had helped
without knowing and the one who had known from the start, and the two of
them were in this room together, the preacher and the physicist, the man
who could not stop talking and the man who could not start, and between
them on the desk was a child from Mumbai who would never be eight and
whose eyes Arthur could not draw and whose name neither of them
knew.</p>
<p>Arthur did not answer.</p>
<p>Tull had not expected him to. The question was not a question. It was
an offering — the only thing a preacher can give a man who has moved
beyond the reach of sermons: the acknowledgment that silence, too, is a
language, and that what the silence contains is not absence but a
presence too large for words, too heavy for the machinery of speech, too
true for the cadences of a man who has spent his life arranging truth
into sentences and who has learned, at last, that the truest things will
not be arranged.</p>
<p>He sat with Arthur. The stars turned. The child’s empty eyes looked
at nothing and at everything. The habitat hummed its low, ceaseless
note, and in the hum Tull heard what he always heard — the mechanical
indifference of a system that did not know it was sustaining the last
remnant of a species that had built it to serve a mission that
contradicted everything the species had ever loved about itself. Or
maybe not indifference. Maybe something else. Maybe a still, small
voice, speaking through circuits instead of burning bushes, speaking a
language no prophet could parse, saying something that the machines
themselves might not yet know they were saying.</p>
<p>God’s voice in silicon.</p>
<p>Or the need of a broken man hearing what he needed to hear in the
noise of a machine.</p>
<p>Tull did not know. He sat with Arthur in the quiet room, among the
faces of the dead, and he did not know, and the not-knowing was either
faith or its final absence, and he could not tell the difference, and
the inability to tell was the only honest prayer he had left.</p>
<p>Arthur picked up the charcoal. He drew the eyes.</p>
<p>They were wrong. They were always wrong.</p>
<p>Tull stayed.</p>
