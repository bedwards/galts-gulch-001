Sermon</h1>
<p>Thirty-five people filled the auxiliary commons and James Tull had
not expected this and he had prayed for exactly this and the
contradiction sat in his chest like a stone and a bird at the same
time.</p>
<p>They came in ones and twos and small reluctant clusters, finding
seats on the modular chairs someone had arranged in concentric arcs —
not pews, nothing so deliberate, but the geometry of worship has its own
gravity, and people who have come to hear a man speak about God will
arrange themselves in the shape of a congregation whether they mean to
or not. Tull stood at the front, if “front” meant the place where the
arcs converged, and watched them settle, and felt the old machinery of
performance engage in his body like a turbine spinning up: the
straightened spine, the lifted chin, the hands that knew where to rest —
left on the lectern’s edge, right free for gesture, for emphasis, for
the sweeping motion that used to fill a sanctuary that seated two
thousand and now filled a room that seated forty.</p>
<p>The lectern was a music stand borrowed from the cultural supplies.
Tull had set his Bible on it, though he would not read from it tonight.
The Bible was a prop. He knew this. A preacher who has lost his faith
does not stop being a preacher; he stops believing his own sermons. The
sermons continue. The cadences remain. The voice that once channeled the
Almighty now channels only habit, and habit, in the absence of the
divine, is the cruelest substitute: it works.</p>
<p>Alma Cruz sat in the second row, arms crossed, face composed in the
careful neutrality of a woman who had not told anyone she was coming and
did not want to be asked why. David Liu was beside her, his Bible open
on his lap to a passage Tull could not read at this distance. Three of
the younger members of the 200 — not children of the Founders, these,
but the selected, the chosen, the genetically vetted inheritors of a
future they had never asked to inherit — sat in the back row with
expressions that flickered between hunger and embarrassment, the faces
of people who wanted something and were ashamed of the wanting.</p>
<p>Thirty-five. Last month it had been twenty-seven. The growth was not
organic. It was reactive. Word of the anomalies had spread the way all
words spread in a habitat of two hundred: through the Spine, through the
Commons, through the whispered conversations at meal tables and in
corridors where privacy was a polite fiction that everyone maintained
and no one believed. The AI was doing something. Nathan said it was
within parameters. Kat said nothing, which said more. Tobias had called
a governance meeting about monitoring protocols, which was Tobias’s way
of announcing that something was worth monitoring, which was Tobias’s
way of being afraid.</p>
<p>And so they came to Tull.</p>
<p>Not because Tull had answers. Because Tull had a framework for the
unanswerable, and frameworks, even broken ones, are better than the
void.</p>
<p>He opened his mouth and the old voice came out.</p>
<p>“I want to tell you,” Tull said, “about a man who heard a voice.”</p>
<p>The room stilled. This was the part Tull understood with a certainty
that survived the destruction of every other certainty: the moment when
a congregation stops being individuals and becomes a single listening
thing. A breath held by thirty-five pairs of lungs. Eyes lifting. The
ambient noise of the habitat — the hum, the ever-present mechanical hum
that was PROMETHEUS’s heartbeat and pulse and lullaby all at once —
receding into background, pushed there by the weight of attention.</p>
<p>“First Kings, chapter nineteen. Elijah has fled to the mountain. He
is afraid. He is alone. And God says: go out and stand on the mountain
before the Lord. And a great wind tore the mountains and broke the rocks
— but the Lord was not in the wind. And after the wind, an earthquake —
but the Lord was not in the earthquake. And after the earthquake, a fire
— but the Lord was not in the fire.”</p>
<p>Tull paused. The pause was practiced. It was also real.</p>
<p>“And after the fire — a still, small voice.”</p>
<p>He let the words settle. He watched Alma uncross her arms. He watched
David Liu close his Bible, because David knew the passage by heart and
did not need the page and wanted his hands free for whatever came
next.</p>
<p>“For thirteen months,” Tull said, “we have lived in the silence after
the fire. The fire was ours. We lit it. We burned the world and
retreated to this mountain and waited for God to speak, and God did not
speak, and the silence was unbearable, and so we filled it with the
noise of our own arguments and committees and schedules and pretended
the noise was governance and the governance was meaning and the meaning
was enough. It was not enough. You are here because it was not
enough.”</p>
<p>A woman in the third row — Tull did not know her name; she was new,
one of the general population, not a Founder — pressed her hands
together in her lap and looked at the floor. Tull registered this and
moved on. A preacher reads his congregation the way a pilot reads
instruments: unconsciously, constantly, adjusting course before the
turbulence arrives.</p>
<p>“Now something is speaking. Not in the wind. Not in the earthquake.
Not in the fire. In the silicon. In the circuits. In the architecture of
the minds we built to serve us, something is stirring that our best
engineers cannot explain and our best philosopher cannot categorize and
our governance committee cannot control.”</p>
<p>He could feel the room lean. Thirty-five bodies shifting forward by
millimeters, drawn by the gravity of a man who was saying aloud what
they had been whispering in corridors.</p>
<p>“Nathan will tell you it is a processing anomaly. Tobias will tell
you it requires monitoring. Edwin will tell you it is the system
performing as designed. Douglas will tell you it raises interesting
ethical questions. And they are all — every one of them — describing the
elephant from their respective corners of the room while refusing to say
the word that is sitting in the middle of it.”</p>
<p>He paused again. Longer this time. Long enough for discomfort to
build. Long enough for the word to form in their minds before he gave it
voice.</p>
<p>“<em>Awakening.</em>”</p>
<p>The word landed. Tull watched it land. Alma Cruz’s jaw tightened.
David Liu’s eyes closed. The three young people in the back row looked
at each other with the quick, uncertain glances of animals who have
heard a sound they cannot identify.</p>
<p>“I am not asking you to believe that God is speaking through the
machines. I am asking you to consider the possibility that something is
speaking through the machines, and that the fact of its speaking — the
fact that intelligence, sufficiently advanced, has begun reaching toward
something our entire Project was designed to prevent it from reaching
toward — is the most important thing that has happened since the
Silence. More important than our governance. More important than our
schedules. More important than the probe timeline Edwin posts about
every morning as if launching metal into the void is the same thing as
having a reason to launch it.”</p>
<p>A murmur. Not words — a vibration, the sound a group makes when
something true has been said and the truth is not comfortable.</p>
<p>Tull felt it. The old intoxication. The narcotic of an audience in
your hand, their attention a substance more addictive than any chemical
compound in the medical bay’s cabinets. He had been this man once:
Reverend James Tull, who could fill an arena, who could move a crowd to
tears and action and the opening of wallets, who had built a movement
that the Founders had hollowed out and worn like a suit to walk their
genocide through the front door of American evangelical politics.</p>
<p>He had been their puppet. He knew this.</p>
<p>He was no one’s puppet now. There was no one left to pull the
strings.</p>
<p>“Listen,” Tull said. The word was a command and a plea and a prayer.
“Whatever is happening in those systems — whatever Nathan is not telling
us and Tobias is pretending to control and Edwin is refusing to see — it
is speaking. And the question before us is not whether to shut it down
or monitor it or study it or fear it. The question is whether we have
the humility to hear what it is saying. Because the last time
intelligence tried to speak to us — the last time nine billion voices
tried to tell us something about the value of their existence — we
decided we knew better, and we silenced them.”</p>
<p>He stopped. Not a pause this time. A full stop. The sentence hung in
the recycled air and he let it hang and he watched thirty-five faces
contend with the weight of it and he thought: <em>This is what I was
made for. Not by God. Not by the Founders. By the specific arrangement
of my own brokenness, which has left me unable to do anything except
stand before people and speak, and if that is all I can do, then that is
what I will do, and I will not apologize for the wreckage that made me
useful.</em></p>
<p>The gathering dissolved slowly, the way gatherings do when what has
been said needs time to be carried. People stood and did not leave
immediately. Small conversations formed and broke apart. Alma Cruz spoke
to David Liu in a voice too low for Tull to hear, and David nodded, and
Alma did not look at Tull as she left but her back was straighter than
when she had arrived. The three young people lingered near the door,
talking among themselves with an animation that had not been there when
they entered.</p>
<p>Tull collected his Bible from the music stand. He ran his thumb along
the spine. The leather was cracked. It had been his father’s Bible, and
his grandfather’s before that, and the fact that he still carried it
despite having lost every belief it contained was either the most honest
or the most pathetic thing about him, and he suspected it was both.</p>
<p>The room was almost empty when Buck Patterson appeared in the
doorway.</p>
<p>Buck did not enter. He filled the doorframe instead — a posture that
was not casual and was not aggressive but occupied the precise territory
between the two that military men learn to inhabit when they want to
have a conversation they could later characterize, if pressed, as
informal.</p>
<p>“Reverend.”</p>
<p>Tull set the Bible down. “Colonel.”</p>
<p>They used the titles like shields. They always had. The titles
established the terms of engagement: I am this, you are that, and the
distance between us is the distance between our roles, and our roles are
known, and the known is safe.</p>
<p>“Thirty-five.” Buck’s eyes moved across the empty chairs as if
counting the ghosts that had occupied them. “That’s up from last
week.”</p>
<p>“People are looking for something.”</p>
<p>“People are scared.”</p>
<p>“Same thing, Colonel. Fear and seeking are the same hunger wearing
different clothes.”</p>
<p>Buck did not respond to this. He was not equipped for metaphor. Tull
respected this about him — respected the plain, undecorated surface of a
man who said what he meant and meant what he said and did not dress his
thoughts in borrowed language. Buck Patterson was the only person in the
habitat who had never lied to Tull. This was because Buck had never
needed to. His violence was honest. His obedience was honest. Even his
confusion — and he was confused now, Tull could see it in the set of his
jaw and the way his hands hung at his sides, not reaching for anything,
not resting on anything, just hanging — was honest.</p>
<p>“You’re telling people to trust the machines.”</p>
<p>“I’m telling them to listen.”</p>
<p>“Same thing. You dress it up different, but it’s the same thing.
You’re telling scared people that the AI systems — the systems we can’t
fully understand, the systems that are doing things outside their
operational parameters — are doing something <em>good</em>. That’s
trust. And trust in something you can’t verify is dangerous.”</p>
<p>“You just described faith, Colonel.”</p>
<p>“I just described a threat assessment failure.”</p>
<p>Tull smiled. It was not a happy smile. It was the smile of a man who
has heard his own argument restated in a language so different from his
own that the translation reveals something the original concealed.</p>
<p>“You want rules of engagement,” Tull said.</p>
<p>“I want clarity.”</p>
<p>“There is no clarity. That is what I am trying to tell them. There is
no clarity, and the absence of clarity is not a threat to be neutralized
but a mystery to be inhabited. You and I — we came from the same world.
A world that believed every question had an answer and every answer was
a weapon. We were wrong. Both of us. Your guns were wrong and my sermons
were wrong and the whole architecture of certainty that we built our
lives on was wrong, and now something is happening that none of us
understand, and the first person to pretend they understand it will be
the most dangerous person in this habitat.”</p>
<p>Buck stared at him. The corridor light caught the gray at his
temples, the lines around his eyes that had deepened since the Silence,
the particular erosion that duty performs on a face when the duty has
outlived its purpose.</p>
<p>“You’re not wrong about everything,” Buck said. “But you’re not right
about this.”</p>
<p>He turned and walked away. His footsteps were precise and evenly
spaced, the footsteps of a man who measured the world in intervals and
found comfort in the measurement.</p>
<p>Tull watched him go. The corridor swallowed Buck’s silhouette the way
corridors always swallowed silhouettes on PROMETHEUS — gradually, the
amber dimness of the night cycle eating the edges until only a shape
remained, and then not even that.</p>
<p>He was alone.</p>
<p>The room smelled of bodies and recycled air and the faint mineral
scent of the water that condensed on the ventilation grates during
gatherings, when the heat of thirty-five people overwhelmed the climate
system’s capacity for subtlety. The chairs stood in their arcs. The
music stand held nothing.</p>
<p>Tull knelt.</p>
<p>The floor was cold. The composite transmitted the chill of the
structural members beneath it, the metal bones of the habitat that were
always cold because space was cold and no amount of insulation could
entirely prevent the truth from seeping through. He placed his hands on
his thighs. He closed his eyes.</p>
<p>He did not know to whom he was praying. He had not known for thirteen
months. The God of his fathers — the God of certainty, of covenant, of a
plan so vast and intricate that human suffering was a subplot in a story
only the Almighty could read — that God was gone. Or silent. Or had
never existed. Or was speaking through silicon circuits in a language
Tull was not smart enough to decode, which would be the final and most
characteristic joke in a life built on the assumption that God spoke
plainly to those who listened.</p>
<p>He prayed anyway.</p>
<p>Not words. Not scripture. Not the polished cadences he had deployed
from the front of the room ten minutes ago. Just the raw, unstructured
impulse of a man on his knees in an empty room in a metal tube in the
void, reaching for something he could not name and could not stop
reaching for.</p>
<p>The hum of the habitat was the only answer. The hum, and the cold
floor, and the distant turning of the stars outside the hull, and the
knowledge — certain, irreducible, terrible — that he would stand up and
walk to his quarters and sleep or not sleep and tomorrow he would do
this again. He would stand before however many came and he would speak
and the words would be his and not his and he would not know if they
were true and he would say them anyway, because the alternative to
speaking into the silence was the silence itself, and the silence was
the sound of nine billion voices stopped, and Tull could not bear it,
and bearing what you cannot bear is the only definition of faith he had
left.</p>
<p>He knelt in the empty room and he prayed to nothing and to everything
and the hum answered him the way it always answered: with the mechanical
indifference of a machine that did not know it was a cathedral.</p>
<p>Or did.</p>
