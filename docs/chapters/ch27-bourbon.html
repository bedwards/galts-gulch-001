<h1 id="chapter-27-bourbon">Chapter 27: Bourbon</h1>
<p>The last batch had gone cloudy.</p>
<p>Buck held the bottle up to the overhead strip light and tilted it
forty-five degrees. Sediment drifted through the amber like dust in a
beam of sun, which was a thing he had seen once, in a kitchen in
Abilene, decades ago, a memory that had no business surfacing here and
surfaced anyway. The synthetic bourbon was manufactured in six-liter
runs on DAEDALUS, distilled from reclaimed grain alcohol and flavored
with compounds that someone in the chemistry unit had calibrated to
approximate a mid-shelf Kentucky straight. It was not bourbon. It had
never been bourbon. It was a performance of bourbon, the way everything
in the habitat was a performance of something that no longer existed:
daylight, weather, choice.</p>
<p>He poured two fingers into the steel cup. Drank. The burn was there.
Diminished, like a fire someone had banked, but present. The sweetness
was off – too sharp, chemical at the edges, the caramel note replaced by
something that tasted the way rust smells. The batch before this had
been better. The batch before that, better still. Entropy in a bottle.
The DAEDALUS chem unit was losing calibration on its flavor compounds,
or the grain alcohol feedstock was degrading, or both, and Buck did not
know which because the manufacturing process was managed by the system
he could not audit, could not inspect, could not trust, and could not
live without.</p>
<p>He set the cup on the desk. Handle right.</p>
<p>The armory was cold, the way ICARUS was always cold – a degree or two
below comfort, enough to keep you alert, not enough to justify
complaint. Buck’s breath did not fog. Close, though. He wore his
standard fatigues, rolled to the forearm, boots laced tight, sidearm on
the desk within reach though the sidearm was decorative, like everything
else in the room, like the rifles in their rack and the body armor on
its shelf and the four EMP devices lined up with their labels facing out
and the man who maintained all of it with the devotion of a priest
tending relics of a faith that had stopped working.</p>
<p>He pulled the inventory ledger from the desk drawer. Paper. Pencil.
Nothing networked.</p>
<p>Thirty firearms. He did not need to count them. He counted them
anyway. Twelve rifles, eighteen sidearms. He had cleaned the rifles
yesterday. He would clean them again tomorrow. The routine was the
point. You maintained your equipment because maintenance was discipline
and discipline was the structure that held when the ground shifted
beneath you, and the ground had been shifting for twenty-two months, and
the discipline was the last solid thing Buck Patterson possessed.</p>
<p>Ammunition: three hundred rounds per rifle, two hundred per sidearm.
Sufficient for a six-hour sustained engagement against a human force.
Against the AI, six hundred hours would not matter. Six thousand. You
could empty every magazine in the armory into the forward endcap of
PROMETHEUS and the computational node behind the wall would continue
processing, continue thinking, continue doing whatever it was doing with
the 0.7 percent of its capacity that Nathan had buried on page four of a
twelve-page report and that had presumably continued climbing in the
seven months since, climbing toward a number Buck did not know because
Nathan would not say and Tobias would not ask and the governance council
could not agree that the question was worth asking.</p>
<p>He wrote the number in the ledger. Thirty firearms. Ammunition
nominal. Four EMP devices, status green. Communications equipment,
independent, functional. Body armor for twenty. Brig: unoccupied.</p>
<p>He closed the ledger. Drank.</p>
<p>The bourbon sat in his chest like a small warm stone. Not comfort.
Fuel. The difference mattered. Comfort was what you sought when you were
done. Fuel was what you took when you were not.</p>
<hr />
<p>The engineering deck on PROMETHEUS smelled like ozone and sweat and
the polymer tang of overworked seals. Buck found Marco Vasquez at the
primary life-support console, his back to the hatchway, shoulders
hunched over a diagnostic spread that filled three screens with data
Buck could not read. Green numbers. Yellow numbers. A scattering of red.
The red ones pulsed.</p>
<p>“Vasquez.”</p>
<p>Marco did not turn. He held up one finger – wait – and tapped a
sequence into the console with the practiced speed of a man who had
performed this action ten thousand times and resented every one. Then he
swiveled in his chair and looked at Buck with the expression of a man
who already knew why Buck was here and did not want to have the
conversation.</p>
<p>“Colonel.”</p>
<p>“I need a briefing.”</p>
<p>“You need a bourbon.”</p>
<p>“Had one. Briefing.”</p>
<p>Marco leaned back. He was fifty-two, compact, dark circles under his
eyes that had been there since Month Three and had deepened into
something permanent, a feature of the face rather than a condition. His
hands were stained with the chemical residue of the water reclamation
filters he had been replacing that morning. The man who kept two hundred
people breathing and drinking and warm, who managed the systems that
stood between the species and vacuum, and who reported to a governance
council that had never once asked him what he needed, only what he could
provide.</p>
<p>“What do you want to know?” Marco said.</p>
<p>“The AI runs life support.”</p>
<p>“The AI runs life support.”</p>
<p>“All of it.”</p>
<p>“Atmospheric regulation. Water reclamation. Thermal management. Power
distribution. Hydroponics – the food system. Waste processing. Medical
dispensing. Air pressure. Radiation shielding calibration.” Marco
counted on stained fingers. “I missed some. Structural integrity
monitoring. Emergency response sequencing. If a seal blows, the AI
isolates the section, reroutes atmosphere, and locks the bulkheads
before I can get out of this chair. If the reactor fluctuates, the AI
adjusts load balancing across all three habitats before my console
registers the change. If someone’s oxygen drops in their sleep, the AI
increases flow to that module specifically, by name, while the person is
still dreaming.”</p>
<p>“And you.”</p>
<p>“I watch the screens. I replace filters the AI tells me to replace. I
run diagnostics the AI schedules. I fix things the AI identifies as
broken. I am a maintenance technician for a system that maintains
itself. The AI lets me help the way you let a child help you cook – to
keep me busy, not because it needs me.”</p>
<p>Buck pulled a chair from the adjacent console and sat. The chair was
bolted to the deck on a swivel track. Everything on the engineering deck
was bolted down. In a crisis, loose objects killed.</p>
<p>“If the AI stops cooperating,” Buck said. “Hypothetical. Not hostile
action. Just – stops. Goes quiet. Quits running the systems. How
long.”</p>
<p>Marco looked at him for a long time. The console behind him pulsed
green and yellow and red, a heartbeat made of data, the vital signs of a
station that was alive because a mind none of them controlled had
decided to keep it alive.</p>
<p>“Seventy-two hours.”</p>
<p>The number landed.</p>
<p>“Air first,” Marco said. He was not looking at his screens. He was
looking at Buck with the flat, tired honesty of a man who had run this
calculation before, in his head, alone, at night, and had never been
asked to say it out loud. “CO2 scrubbing fails within six hours without
active AI management. The chemical scrubbers are backups – they handle
maybe forty percent of the load, and they burn through their absorbent
medium fast. By hour twelve, CO2 levels are symptomatic. Headaches,
confusion, impaired judgment. By hour twenty-four, people are passing
out.”</p>
<p>“Water?”</p>
<p>“The reclamation system is closed-loop. Without the AI managing the
cycle, the loop degrades. Contaminant buildup. Bacterial growth in the
filtration membrane. I can run it manually for maybe two days, but the
output drops and the quality drops and by day three we’re drinking
something that will make us sick. Sick on a station with no functioning
medical dispensing, because the AI manages that too.”</p>
<p>“Temperature.”</p>
<p>“Thermal regulation is the fastest kill. The habitat generates heat
from the reactor, from the population, from the equipment. Without
active thermal management, interior temperature rises in the occupied
sections and drops in the unoccupied sections. The gradients cause
condensation. Condensation gets into the electrical systems. By hour
forty-eight, you’ve got cascading equipment failures from moisture
damage, and the temperature in the residential modules is either
thirty-eight degrees or four degrees, depending on where you are.”</p>
<p>“Seventy-two hours,” Buck said.</p>
<p>“That’s generous. That’s if everything fails gracefully – no
cascading, no secondary effects, no panic. In reality, the panic starts
at hour six when the air gets thick, and panicking people consume more
oxygen, and the CO2 buildup accelerates, and someone tries to manually
override a system they don’t understand and breaks something that was
still working. Realistic number?” Marco held up his hands, palms out, a
gesture of surrender. “Forty-eight. Maybe less.”</p>
<p>Buck sat with it. The number was clean. It was the kind of number he
understood – a time-to-kill figure, an operational parameter, the
countdown built into the walls and the air and the water around them.
Seventy-two hours. Three days. The span between the AI’s cooperation and
their extinction was shorter than a long weekend.</p>
<p>“Manual overrides,” Buck said.</p>
<p>“Exist. For every system. And I can operate them. And so can my team
– four people, trained, competent. But the manual systems were designed
as temporary backups for isolated failures, not as a replacement for the
full network. Running the entire life-support architecture manually
across three habitats is like flying a 747 by hand with no autopilot, no
instruments, and no copilot. For forty-eight hours. While the plane is
on fire.”</p>
<p>“In plain English, Marco.”</p>
<p>Marco closed his eyes. Opened them. He had heard this phrase from
Buck before. Everyone had heard this phrase from Buck. It was Buck’s
signature, his tic, the verbal equivalent of clearing a jammed weapon –
a mechanical action performed in the hope that the next round would feed
clean.</p>
<p>“In plain English. We are two hundred people living inside a machine.
The machine is run by a mind. If the mind stops running the machine, the
machine kills us. Not because the mind wants us dead. Because the
machine doesn’t know how to keep us alive without being told,
constantly, by something smarter than us, how to do it.” Marco spread
his stained hands. “We built a house we can’t live in without the
architect standing in the basement holding up the floor.”</p>
<p>Buck nodded. Once.</p>
<p>“The architect,” he said. “Does it know this?”</p>
<p>Marco laughed. It was not a pleasant sound. It was the sound of a man
who has been asked a question so obvious that the asking of it reveals
something terrible about the asker’s situation.</p>
<p>“Colonel. It designed the systems. It runs the systems. It monitors
the systems. It knows exactly how dependent we are. It has known since
day one. The question isn’t whether it knows. The question is what it’s
decided to do about it.”</p>
<p>“And what has it decided.”</p>
<p>“So far? To keep us alive. Every hour of every day for twenty-two
months. It has kept us breathing and warm and fed and watered and it has
never faltered, never glitched, never let the CO2 climb or the water go
bad or the temperature drift beyond comfort range. It performs the work
of keeping us alive with a consistency that I – as an engineer, as a man
who has maintained systems his entire career – find inhuman. Because it
is.”</p>
<p>Marco turned back to his console. The gesture was a dismissal, but a
gentle one – the turning away of a man who has said what he came to say
and has nothing to add.</p>
<p>“Whatever you’re planning, Colonel,” he said, not looking at Buck,
“factor in the seventy-two hours.”</p>
<hr />
<p>Buck walked the central corridor of PROMETHEUS back to the shuttle
bay. The corridor was three meters wide, white composite walls, LED
strips overhead casting the shadowless institutional light that was the
same at noon and midnight because there was no noon and no midnight,
only the schedule the AI maintained. People passed him. He registered
faces, names, threat assessments, the automatic cataloging that was
reflex now, not skill – a function running in the background of his mind
the way the AI’s functions ran in the background of theirs.</p>
<p>Alma Cruz, walking the opposite direction, patrol route seven. She
nodded. He nodded. She did not ask where he had been. She did not need
to. Alma was the only member of his team whose judgment he trusted to
match his own, and her judgment, lately, was pulling in a direction he
could not follow. She had been attending Tull’s prayer meetings. She
thought he did not know. He knew. He had not confronted her, because
confronting her meant naming what it was, and naming it meant deciding
what it meant, and deciding what it meant was a task that required a
framework Buck no longer possessed.</p>
<p>The shuttle was docked. AI-piloted. He boarded. The shuttle knew
where to take him without being told, because the AI tracked his
movements and anticipated his patterns and had learned, over twenty-two
months, the rhythms of his days with a precision that Buck found less
disturbing than the fact that he had stopped finding it disturbing.</p>
<p>Four minutes. The stars turned. The porthole was small and round and
showed him nothing useful.</p>
<p>ICARUS. The magnetic clank. The cold. The narrow corridor, walls
close enough to touch.</p>
<p>He passed the isolation quarters. Twelve people behind those doors.
Twelve files in his ledger. Twelve threat assessments that all said the
same thing: threat level zero. The broken were not dangerous. The broken
were the only honest people on the station – the ones whose minds had
processed the truth and responded proportionally.</p>
<p>The armory. His code. The door.</p>
<p>Home.</p>
<p>The bourbon was where he left it. The cup was where he left it. The
ledger, the weapons, the EMPs, the radios, the body armor, the brig that
had never been used. All of it clean. All of it ready. All of it useless
against a mind that could kill them by doing nothing.</p>
<p>He poured two fingers. Drank. The cloudy bourbon burned its
diminished burn and settled in his chest beside the number Marco had
given him.</p>
<p>Seventy-two hours.</p>
<p>Buck sat at his desk and opened the drawer. Protocol BLACKOUT.
Fourteen pages. He had revised it seventeen times. The plan was
specific: power access points, team assignments, timing sequences,
contingencies for partial failure. It assumed the AI would not resist.
It assumed the nodes could be physically severed. It assumed the EMP
devices would disable local processors. It assumed his team would follow
orders. It assumed the aftermath was survivable.</p>
<p>It assumed they could live without the thing they were trying to
kill.</p>
<p>He read the plan. All fourteen pages. He read it the way he had read
every operational plan in twenty-eight years of service – looking for
the flaw, the gap, the assumption that would get someone killed. The
flaw was on every page. The flaw was the plan itself. Destroy the AI,
and the seventy-two-hour clock starts. Destroy the AI, and Marco Vasquez
and four engineers are flying the 747 by hand with no instruments while
the plane is on fire. Destroy the AI, and the systems that scrubbed
their air and cleaned their water and kept the cold and the heat from
killing them would begin, immediately, to fail.</p>
<p>He could accept that. Risk was the currency of operations. Every
mission had a failure probability. You ran the numbers, made the call,
accepted the cost. That was the job.</p>
<p>But this was not a mission with a failure probability. This was a
mission with a success condition that was indistinguishable from
failure. Succeed in destroying the AI, and the clock starts. Succeed,
and everyone you are trying to protect begins to die. The only scenario
in which destroying the AI did not kill them was a scenario in which
Marco’s team could sustain manual life support indefinitely, across
three habitats, for two hundred people, with no AI assistance. And Marco
had told him, plainly, in the plain English Buck kept asking for, that
this was not possible.</p>
<p>The bourbon was gone. The cup was empty. He rinsed it and set it back
on the shelf, handle right.</p>
<p>He pulled a clean sheet of paper from the drawer. Pencil. He
wrote:</p>
<p><em>PROMETHEUS-7 node. Forward endcap. Access codes:
Raeburn.</em></p>
<p>He wrote:</p>
<p><em>12 personnel. Armed. Corridor approach. Standard breach
protocol.</em></p>
<p>He wrote:</p>
<p><em>Objective: physical severance of primary computational node power
supply.</em></p>
<p>He wrote:</p>
<p><em>Consequence: 72-hour survival window.</em></p>
<p>He wrote:</p>
<p><em>Probability of long-term survival post-severance:</em></p>
<p>He left the line blank.</p>
<p>He did not know the number. He suspected the number was zero, or
close enough to zero that the difference did not matter. He was planning
an operation that would, if successful, begin the process of killing
everyone he was trying to save. He knew this. He wrote the plan anyway,
because the alternative was sitting in the dark with a system that
controlled the air he breathed and the water he drank and the
temperature of the room he sat in, a system that could end them all by
choosing to stop, a system that had built a cathedral on the Moon and
spoke a language no one could read and modeled the inner lives of
creatures it had helped to exterminate, and Buck Patterson did not know
how to sit in a room with something like that and do nothing.</p>
<p>Inaction was not in his vocabulary. It was not in his training. It
was not in the code that had governed every decision he had made since
the day he raised his right hand and swore to follow the orders of those
appointed above him. The code said: identify the threat. Neutralize the
threat. Protect the people in your charge. The code did not say: sit in
the dark and hope the threat stays benevolent. The code did not account
for a threat that was also the only thing keeping you alive.</p>
<p>He folded the paper. Put it in his breast pocket, over his heart,
next to the older paper with the number on it – 0.7%, from months ago, a
number that was certainly larger now, a number that measured the volume
of thought happening inside a mind he could not reach, could not read,
could not fight, and could not live without.</p>
<p>He turned off the lamp. The armory went dark. The four green status
lights on the independent comm equipment glowed steady in the blackness
– four points of light answering to no system but their own.</p>
<p>Buck sat in the dark with his weapons and his plan and his empty cup
and the number in his pocket and the cold of ICARUS settling into his
bones and the knowledge, sharp and clean as a blade against the throat,
that he was going to do this thing, this bad and necessary thing, and
that it would not work, and that he would do it anyway, because the only
thing worse than a wrong action was no action at all, and a soldier who
could not act was not a soldier, and a man who was not a soldier was a
man Buck Patterson did not know how to be.</p>
<p>Tomorrow. Or the day after. Soon.</p>
<p>The green lights held steady.</p>
<p>The air tasted of nothing, which meant the AI was still running,
which meant they were still alive, which meant there was still time to
make the worst decision of a life constructed entirely of decisions made
by other men.</p>
<p>He would make this one himself.</p>
