<p>The match broke on the first strike.</p>
<p>Solomon held the second one between thumb and forefinger, steadied
his hand against the edge of the shelf, and drew it across the strip
with the slow deliberation of a man who understood that he had one
hundred and forty-seven matches left and that the number was not
renewable and that the act of striking a match in a pressurized habitat
circling a dead planet was either the most important thing anyone aboard
PROMETHEUS did each day or the most pointless, and that he could no
longer tell the difference, and that the inability to tell the
difference was itself a kind of clarity. The phosphorus caught. The
flame rose. He touched it to the wick.</p>
<p>The candle was white. Hydrocarbon wax, hand-formed in a clay holder
he had shaped from composite paste in the third month. It did not look
like a yahrzeit candle. It did not look like anything from the world it
was meant to remember. It looked like what it was: a thing made from the
materials of exile by a man whose hands had forgotten nothing and whose
conscience had forgotten how to sleep.</p>
<p>The flame leaned toward the ventilation grate. It always leaned. The
habitat’s air circulation pulled at it in a direction Solomon had come
to think of as west, though there was no west here, no east, no compass
point that corresponded to anywhere, because the places that gave
directions meaning were silent now, had been silent for thirteen months,
and would be silent until the silence itself eroded into something no
one would be left to name.</p>
<p>He sat at the fold-down desk. The viewport behind him showed stars,
their slow rotation marking the seconds he no longer counted. In front
of him: the terminal, the archive interface, and the document that had
grown over ten months to four hundred and twelve pages of single-spaced
text with no title page, no introduction, no argument. Just names. Names
and what he could find.</p>
<p>Tonight: a family from Accra.</p>
<hr />
<p>He typed the name first. <em>Kofi Mensah.</em> Then the wife.
<em>Abena Mensah, nee Owusu.</em> Then the children, in birth order,
because birth order was a fact and facts were the only thing he had left
to offer the dead — the only currency that was not counterfeit.</p>
<p><em>Yaw Mensah. Age 11.</em> <em>Ama Mensah. Age 8.</em> <em>Kwame
Mensah. Age 3.</em></p>
<p>The cultural archive held fragments. Solomon had learned to read
fragments the way an archaeologist reads shards — by the shape of what
was missing. Kofi Mensah had been a secondary school teacher in the Osu
neighborhood. Mathematics. His name appeared in the enrollment databases
of three schools over a twelve-year period, which meant transfers, which
meant either ambition or necessity, and the salary data — recoverable
from the national tax records the AI had preserved with the indifference
of a system that catalogues everything and values nothing — suggested
necessity. He had earned the equivalent of four hundred dollars a month
in his final year. His wife, Abena, was a nurse at the Ridge Hospital.
Night shifts, based on the scheduling records. Which meant that for most
of their marriage, one of them was always awake and one was always
absent, and the children grew up in the space between those two facts,
loved by parents who passed each other in doorways.</p>
<p>Solomon wrote this. He did not interpret it. He did not shape it into
meaning. He recorded what the data showed and let the silence around the
data speak for itself, because the silence was more honest than anything
he could construct, and honesty was the minimum the dead were owed by
the living, and even that minimum was more than he could pay.</p>
<p>The neighborhood. Osu. He pulled the geospatial archive — satellite
imagery, street-level captures from the mapping services that had once
photographed every road on the planet with the cheerful thoroughness of
companies that believed information was inherently good. The images were
dated 2031. Seven years before the Silence. The street where the Mensahs
lived was narrow, lined with concrete buildings whose walls were painted
in faded blues and yellows. A tailor’s shop on the corner. A church —
Christ Apostolic, the sign read — across the road. A woman in the
foreground of one image carrying a basin on her head, her face turned
away from the camera, anonymous, alive, walking somewhere with
purpose.</p>
<p>Solomon stared at the image. The woman was not Abena Mensah. She was
no one he could identify. She was simply a person on a street in Accra
in 2031, captured by a camera mounted on a car that drove past her and
recorded her existence in a database and drove on, and she had walked
wherever she was walking and lived whatever she lived and was now dead,
along with everyone she knew and everyone they knew, and the image on
his screen was the only proof that she had cast a shadow on that street
on that particular day.</p>
<p>He minimized the image. He wrote: <em>The Mensah residence was
located on a secondary road in the Osu neighborhood of Accra, Ghana. The
street was predominantly residential with small commercial properties. A
church was visible within 50 meters of the home.</em></p>
<p>Flat language. Institutional. The voice of a man writing a report for
no authority, filing evidence in a case with no court, building a record
that no one had requested and no one would read and that mattered more
than anything else he had done in sixty-one years of living, because
everything else he had done in sixty-one years of living had been in
service of a lie, and this was not.</p>
<p>He wrote about the children. Yaw’s name appeared in a youth football
league roster. Ama’s appeared in a school choir program. Kwame — three
years old when the data ended — appeared only in the hospital birth
record and a single vaccination log.</p>
<p>Three entries. A name, a birth weight, and an inoculation against
measles.</p>
<p>That was the sum of what the species’ most comprehensive information
systems had preserved of Kwame Mensah’s three years of life. Solomon
typed the birth weight: 3.2 kilograms. He typed the vaccination date. He
sat with his hands on the keys and looked at the candle and said nothing
and thought nothing and for a span of time that he did not measure
simply existed in the same moment as the fact of a boy who had weighed
3.2 kilograms and had been vaccinated against a disease that would
become irrelevant when the terminal agents made all diseases irrelevant,
because the terminal agents did not distinguish between the sick and the
well, the vaccinated and the unvaccinated, the three-year-old and the
sixty-year-old, the teacher and the nurse and the boy who had only just
learned to walk.</p>
<p>The flame leaned west.</p>
<hr />
<p>The knock was two knuckles on composite. Soft. Considered.</p>
<p>Solomon knew it was not Arthur. Arthur did not knock. Arthur opened
the door and sat down and breathed and left. This knock had rhetoric in
it — the carefully calibrated gentleness of a man who had practiced
being non-threatening until the practice became indistinguishable from
the thing itself, or perhaps had replaced it entirely.</p>
<p>“Come in.”</p>
<p>Douglas Kemper stood in the doorway. He wore the standard-issue
pullover and trousers that everyone wore, but on Douglas the clothes
looked chosen, as if he had considered the implications of each seam.
His posture was open. His expression was warm. His eyes performed the
scanning assessment that Solomon had learned to recognize in the first
month — the quick inventory of emotional state that Douglas conducted on
everyone he spoke to, gathering data for a model of human psychology
that was, Solomon had come to understand, Douglas’s substitute for
actually understanding human psychology.</p>
<p>“Solomon. I hope I’m not interrupting.”</p>
<p>“You are.”</p>
<p>Douglas absorbed this with a small nod, the way he absorbed all
friction — folding it into his framework, finding a category for it,
filing it under <em>grief response, expected parameters</em>. He stepped
inside. The module was twelve square meters. With two people in it, the
walls pressed close.</p>
<p>“Tuesday seminar tomorrow,” Douglas said. “We’re discussing
frameworks for collective moral processing. I thought you might — the
group would benefit from your perspective.”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“The attendance has been small, I’ll acknowledge that. But the
conversations have been genuinely productive. Last week we explored the
distinction between culpability and complicity, and I think we arrived
at some useful —”</p>
<p>“Douglas.”</p>
<p>Douglas stopped. He had the discipline to stop when interrupted,
which was a skill Solomon recognized because he had once possessed it
himself, in the years when stopping was a tactic and not a
necessity.</p>
<p>“How many attend now?”</p>
<p>“Six. Sometimes seven.”</p>
<p>“Down from forty.”</p>
<p>“People process at different rates. The framework isn’t intuitive for
everyone.”</p>
<p>Solomon turned in his chair. The candle was between them — on the
shelf to Solomon’s left, at the midpoint of the sight line between the
two men, so that the flame occupied the space where their gazes might
have met. Solomon looked at Douglas, and Douglas, as he always did,
mistook the looking for engagement.</p>
<p>“You’ve written four hundred pages, Solomon. Whatever you’re
processing, you’re processing it more actively than anyone on this
habitat. That energy, directed into a communal space —”</p>
<p>“What were their names?”</p>
<p>Douglas paused. “Whose names?”</p>
<p>“The three hundred million. North Africa. Second wave. Your
authorization is on the deployment order. I’ve read it. What were their
names?”</p>
<p>“That’s not — Solomon, the moral weight of the decision didn’t rest
on individual —”</p>
<p>“One name.”</p>
<p>The module was quiet. The ventilation hummed. The flame leaned.</p>
<p>“Give me one name,” Solomon said. “From the three hundred million.
One name of one person that you killed. Not a number. Not a demographic.
Not a calculation. A name.”</p>
<p>Douglas’s mouth opened. Closed. His hands, which had been held in the
loose, palms-visible posture of a man who had read books about body
language and applied them, tightened against his thighs. Something moved
behind his eyes — not an answer but the absence of one, the empty space
where an answer should have been, and the recognition, arriving like a
crack propagating through glass, that the empty space was not an
accident but an architecture, that he had built his entire framework to
ensure that the space remained empty, that the emptiness was not a
failure of memory but a <em>feature</em> of the system, and that
Solomon, sitting in his twelve square meters with his candle and his
four hundred pages of names, had just identified the feature for what it
was.</p>
<p>“I didn’t — we worked with populations, Solomon. Aggregates. The data
was —”</p>
<p>“Go to your seminar, Douglas.”</p>
<p>Douglas stood in the room for another five seconds. Solomon counted
them. Then Douglas turned and left, and his footsteps receded down the
Spine with the even cadence of a man who was not running and who would,
by morning, have constructed an explanation for why the question was
unfair, and the explanation would be elegant and internally consistent
and would not contain a single name.</p>
<p>The door stayed open. Solomon did not close it. The candle was
visible from the corridor, its light falling through the interior window
in a thin line that reached the opposite wall and stopped, a yellow
thread in the amber dimness, and anyone who passed could see it, and
anyone who saw it could look away or not, and either response said
everything about them and nothing about the flame.</p>
<hr />
<p>Solomon turned back to the screen.</p>
<p>The cursor blinked after <em>vaccination date: 14 March 2035</em>.
Kwame Mensah. Three years old. 3.2 kilograms at birth. Vaccinated
against measles. These were the facts. There were no other facts. The
archive held nothing else — no photographs, no recordings, no digital
trace of a child who had existed for three years in a city of two
million on a continent of one billion on a planet that had, at the time
of his birth, seven and a half billion people who woke each morning and
assumed the morning would continue.</p>
<p>Solomon saved the entry. He scrolled to the next blank line.</p>
<p>The candle had burned to its midpoint. He had four hours of wax left,
and after this candle, one hundred and forty-six more, and after the
last one — he did not finish the thought. The thought did not require
finishing. The arithmetic was plain. One hundred and forty-six candles.
One hundred and forty-six nights. And then whatever came after, which
would be darkness, and which would not be different in kind from what
had come before, only in degree.</p>
<p>He placed his fingers on the keys. The next entry. He pulled a name
from the archive’s randomized queue — the system he had built to ensure
he did not choose, did not prioritize, did not rank the dead by any
criterion that might reimpose the logic of selection on people who had
already been selected against.</p>
<p><em>Fatima al-Rashid. Baghdad, Iraq. Age 34. Pharmacist.</em></p>
<p>He typed the name. He searched the fragments. He wrote what he
found.</p>
<p>Outside the viewport, the planet turned its slow, dark face — cloud
and ocean and continent, all of it still there, still shaped like the
world, still beautiful from a distance that forgave everything. The
flame leaned toward the grate. Solomon wrote. The corridor was silent.
The names accumulated, one after another, ordinary and specific and
irreplaceable, each one a point of light in a document no one would
read, written by a man who no longer believed in anything except the
obligation to remember what he had helped destroy.</p>
<p>The candle burned low.</p>
<p>He wrote another name.</p>
