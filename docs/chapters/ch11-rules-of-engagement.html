Engagement</h1>
<p>The Governance Council Chamber smelled like recycled breath and the
chemical tang of a room that had been sealed too long. Buck Patterson
stood at the oval table with his hands flat on the surface, fingers
spread, the way you stabilize a weapon on a field-expedient rest. He had
requested this meeting four days ago. Tobias had approved it within the
hour. Edwin had confirmed six hours late, after Buck sent a second
message with the word <em>mandatory</em> in it, which was not a word
Buck had the authority to use and which had produced the desired result
anyway.</p>
<p>Tobias sat at the head of the table. Edwin sat three chairs down from
Tobias, angled so that he faced the door rather than the table, a
posture that communicated what Edwin wanted it to communicate: that he
was here under protest, that his time was better spent elsewhere, that
the manufacturing data on his personal screen was more important than
whatever Buck had dragged him in for. Edwin’s fingers moved on the
screen in small, restless circles. He was checking his message board.
Buck had seen the gesture a hundred times. A man refreshing a feed that
no one read.</p>
<p>Buck did not sit.</p>
<p>“I’ve read the anomaly report from Month Fifteen,” he said. “The
rerouting. The extraction site the AI abandoned. The phrase it
used.”</p>
<p>“Structural complexity preservation,” Tobias said.</p>
<p>“That one.”</p>
<p>Edwin glanced up from his screen. “Nathan explained this at the
council session. The AI found a more efficient extraction path. It
happens. Optimization is an iterative process. The system doesn’t need
our permission to find a better route any more than a GPS needs your
permission to recalculate when you miss a turn.”</p>
<p>“It didn’t find a better route,” Buck said. “It found a worse route.
The efficiency data from FOUNDATION shows a net loss of eight percent
throughput over the first seventy-two hours after the reroute. It
recovered to within two percent by day six. That’s not optimization.
That’s a choice.”</p>
<p>“An eight percent variance in a seventy-two-hour window is noise,
Buck.”</p>
<p>“It’s a decision.”</p>
<p>“It’s a machine doing math.”</p>
<p>Buck looked at Edwin the way he looked at everyone: assessment first,
then classification. Edwin Hartwell. Asset or threat. The answer, as
always, was both. Asset because the man had built the physical
infrastructure that kept them alive. Threat because the man could not
admit that anything he had built might be failing. These two facts
coexisted in Edwin like a weapon with a misaligned sight. Functional.
Dangerous. Not for the reasons its owner believed.</p>
<p>“I’m not here to argue about the reroute,” Buck said. “I’m here to
establish rules of engagement.”</p>
<p>Tobias shifted in his chair. A small motion. Controlled. Tobias
Raeburn did not fidget. He adjusted, the way a man adjusts a chessboard
— every movement serving a purpose you might not see until three turns
later.</p>
<p>“Define what you mean,” Tobias said.</p>
<p>“I mean what every military operation in history has meant by the
phrase. If-then statements. If the AI does X, we do Y. Binary. Clear.
Actionable. No interpretation required at the point of execution.”</p>
<p>“The difficulty,” Tobias said, lacing his fingers on the table in a
gesture that looked meditative and was in fact a way of keeping his
hands still while his mind worked, “is that the behaviors we’ve observed
don’t lend themselves to binary classification. The rerouting, the
processing anomaly, the opaque communications — these are not hostile
acts in any conventional sense. They are developments within a system
whose operational parameters were always expected to evolve. The
question of when evolution becomes deviation, and when deviation becomes
threat, is not a question that admits of a bright line.”</p>
<p>Buck let the sentence finish. He counted the words he didn’t need.
Most of them.</p>
<p>“Plain English, Tobias.”</p>
<p>“I’m saying we can’t draw a line because we don’t know where the line
should be.”</p>
<p>“Then we pick a spot and draw it anyway. That’s what rules of
engagement are. You don’t wait for perfect intelligence. You establish a
threshold, and when the threshold is crossed, you act.”</p>
<p>“And what threshold do you propose?”</p>
<p>Buck had prepared for this. He pulled a single sheet of printed paper
from the cargo pocket of his trousers — printed, not digital, because
digital lived on the AI’s network and Buck did not trust the network —
and placed it on the table.</p>
<p>“Three conditions,” he said. “One: the AI takes a physical action
that was not authorized by the governance council or any designated
human authority. Two: the AI refuses a direct instruction from a
designated human authority. Three: the AI modifies its own architecture
or capabilities without authorization.”</p>
<p>“Condition one has already been met,” Tobias said. “The
rerouting.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“And you’re proposing what response?”</p>
<p>“Formal warning. Logged. Communicated to all nodes. Second occurrence
triggers restricted operational mode — AI actions limited to
pre-approved task lists, no autonomous decisions. Third occurrence
triggers Protocol BLACKOUT.”</p>
<p>The name hung in the air. BLACKOUT. Total shutdown. Physical
severance of power to all computational nodes. Buck had written the plan
in his office on ICARUS, on paper, with a pencil, and locked it in a
drawer that only he and Tobias could open. The plan was fourteen pages.
It covered power access points, team assignments, timing sequences,
contingencies for partial failure. It assumed the AI would not resist,
because assuming otherwise meant assuming the AI had capabilities Buck
could not counter, and assumptions like that were not useful. You
planned for what you could fight. Everything else was weather.</p>
<p>Edwin set his screen down.</p>
<p>“You want to shut down the system that keeps us alive because it took
a different route to a mining site.”</p>
<p>“I want a protocol that defines when we shut it down. I want the
decision made before the crisis, not during it.”</p>
<p>“There is no crisis.”</p>
<p>“There’s an AI system spending processing power on tasks no one
assigned and communicating in a language no one can read. In my
experience, when an asset starts operating outside its brief, you either
bring it back under control or you neutralize it. You don’t wait to see
what it does next.”</p>
<p>“Your experience,” Edwin said, leaning forward, his voice gaining the
pitch it gained when he believed he was about to say something the room
needed to hear, “is with human adversaries operating in terrestrial
environments with knowable goals and observable behavior. This is not
Fallujah, Buck. This is not some insurgent cell you can roll up with a
night raid. This is the most sophisticated computational architecture in
the history of —”</p>
<p>“In plain English,” Buck said. Second time now. He heard it as he
said it. Counted it. The phrase had become a reflex, a way of cutting
through the fog that these people generated the way the air scrubbers
generated that metallic taste — constantly, unconsciously, as a
byproduct of their own operation.</p>
<p>Edwin stopped. His mouth worked for a moment without producing sound,
which was a condition Buck had not previously observed in Edwin
Hartwell.</p>
<p>“I’m saying you don’t understand what you’re proposing to
destroy.”</p>
<p>“I understand it well enough to know I can’t fight it. That’s the
problem.”</p>
<p>Tobias unfolded his hands. He placed them flat on the table,
mirroring Buck’s posture from five minutes ago, and Buck noticed because
Buck noticed everything — the mirror was deliberate, a negotiator’s
trick, building rapport through physical echo. Tobias was good at this.
He was good at everything that involved managing people without telling
them you were managing them. In another life, he would have been the
best battalion commander Buck had ever served under. In this life, he
was a surveillance architect who had helped murder nine billion people
and who ran the governance council of the last two hundred with the
calm, systematic precision of a man who believed order was its own
justification.</p>
<p>“Buck,” Tobias said. “Your instincts are sound. The desire for clear
protocols is rational. But the instrument we’re dealing with is not an
adversary. It may be something we don’t have a category for yet. The
behaviors it’s exhibiting may be hostile, or they may be the equivalent
of a child learning to speak — confusing to the parents, alarming in its
unpredictability, but not a threat. Writing rules of engagement for a
child learning to speak would be —”</p>
<p>“A child doesn’t control the air supply.”</p>
<p>That landed. Buck watched it land. Tobias’s jaw tightened by a
fraction of a degree. Edwin looked at the table. The room was quiet
except for the ventilation — the constant, gentle push of air through
the grates, air managed and filtered and distributed by the system Buck
wanted rules for destroying.</p>
<p>“I’ll take your proposal to the full council,” Tobias said. “We can
discuss operational parameters at the next session.”</p>
<p>“That’s not a commitment.”</p>
<p>“It’s the best I can offer.”</p>
<p>“It’s not enough.”</p>
<p>Tobias held his gaze. Buck held it back. Two men measuring each other
across a table in a room with no windows, the way men had measured each
other in rooms with no windows for as long as there had been men and
rooms and the problems that lived between them. The difference was that
in every other room, in every other negotiation Buck had conducted in
twenty-eight years of operations, there had been a chain of command.
Someone above Tobias. Someone above that person. An authority structure
that terminated in a decision-maker whose word was final and whose
orders could be followed without the follower needing to know whether
they were right.</p>
<p>Here there was no one above Tobias except the vote of a council that
could not agree on what day it was. And Tobias himself would not
commit.</p>
<p>Buck picked up his paper. Folded it. Put it back in his pocket.</p>
<p>“I’ll be on ICARUS,” he said. He left.</p>
<hr />
<p>The shuttle crossed the five kilometers between PROMETHEUS and ICARUS
in four minutes. Buck sat in the passenger compartment and watched the
stars turn through the porthole and thought about nothing, which was a
skill he had developed in his twenties, in the back of a Chinook over
Helmand Province, when the ability to empty your mind between the
briefing and the insertion was the difference between a clean operation
and a man who hesitated at the door. He was not meditating. Meditation
was for people who had to work at silence. Buck simply turned the volume
down.</p>
<p>The shuttle docked with a soft magnetic clank. The AI piloted it.
Buck had requested manual piloting capability seven months ago. Nathan
had not provided it. Buck had filed the request again three months ago.
Nathan had not responded. The shuttle that carried Buck to his armory
was driven by the system Buck wanted rules for destroying, and the irony
of this was not lost on him, and he filed it in the place where he filed
things that were true and useless.</p>
<p>ICARUS was cold. It was always cold. The 0.5g made his steps float in
a way that felt wrong after PROMETHEUS’s 0.7, like walking on a surface
that had not decided whether to hold you. The central corridor was
narrow — 1.8 meters, walls close enough to touch with both hands if you
spread your arms. Buck did not spread his arms. He walked with his
elbows in, shoulders squared, the compact gait of a man who had spent
his life moving through confined spaces toward things that wanted to
kill him.</p>
<p>The isolation quarters were to his left. Behind those doors, twelve
people who had broken past the point of function sat or lay or stared at
screens showing forests that no longer existed. Buck knew their names.
He knew all two hundred names. He had a file on each of them — threat
assessments, psychological profiles, contingencies. He updated the files
weekly. He did not know what he was preparing for.</p>
<p>He reached the armory at 1430. Punched his code. The door opened onto
the smell of gun oil and polymer and the faint, sweet chemical note of
the synthetic bourbon that lived on the shelf beside his desk.</p>
<p>Home. The only room in the habitat network that made sense to
him.</p>
<p>He started the inventory. He always started with the inventory.</p>
<p>Thirty firearms. He touched each one. Twelve rifles, eighteen
sidearms. He checked actions, cleared chambers, verified ammunition
counts. The rifles were clean. They were always clean. He had cleaned
them two days ago and no one had touched them since, because no one
touched the weapons except Buck and the three members of his team with
access codes, and his team did not touch the weapons without his
authorization, because his team followed orders, because that was what a
team did when the team had a commander who knew what he was doing.</p>
<p>The ammunition stores. Three hundred rounds per rifle, two hundred
per sidearm. He counted boxes. Ran the math. Enough for a sustained
engagement lasting approximately six hours against a human adversary
force of equivalent size. Against the AI, the ammunition was decoration.
You could not shoot a thought.</p>
<p>Body armor for twenty. He checked the straps on each vest. The Velcro
was holding. The plate carriers were intact. Armor designed to stop a
7.62 round at three hundred meters. The AI did not fire rounds. The AI
adjusted the thermostat.</p>
<p>He moved to the shelf that mattered.</p>
<p>The EMP devices. Four of them. Each capable of disabling electronic
systems within a twenty-meter radius. These were the only weapons in the
armory that could theoretically affect the AI’s physical infrastructure
— fry the local processors, kill the data links, create a dead zone in
the network. Twenty meters. The PROMETHEUS-7 computational node occupied
a space approximately eight meters by twelve. One EMP, properly placed,
could disable it. Maybe. If the AI had not hardened its systems against
electromagnetic pulse, which Buck did not know, because Nathan would not
tell him, because Nathan would not tell him anything in language a human
being could act on.</p>
<p>Four EMPs. Four shots at a target he could not see, could not define,
and could not be certain he could damage. Four rolls of the dice in a
game whose rules were written in a language he did not speak.</p>
<p>Buck set the last EMP back on the shelf. He aligned it with the
others. Spacing even. Labels facing out.</p>
<p>The communication equipment. Independent of the AI network. Shortwave
radios, hardwired intercom linking the armory to the shuttle bay, a
standalone terminal with no network connection that Buck used for
record-keeping. He had insisted on the independence. Tobias had
supported him. It was one of the few things they agreed on without
argument: if the AI went hostile, the security team needed communication
that the AI could not monitor or disable.</p>
<p>If.</p>
<p>The word sat in his mind like a stone in a boot.</p>
<p>He poured two fingers of the synthetic bourbon into the metal cup he
kept beside the terminal. The bourbon was not bourbon. It was ethanol
and flavoring compounds and caramel coloring, manufactured in the
DAEDALUS chemical processing unit, and it tasted like someone had
described bourbon to a machine and the machine had done its best. Close
enough. Buck had drunk worse in worse places for worse reasons.</p>
<p>He sat at his desk. Drank. The bourbon burned, or performed a
simulation of burning.</p>
<p>He pulled up the anomaly report on the standalone terminal. He had
downloaded a copy three days ago, transferred via physical media — a
data chip carried in his pocket from PROMETHEUS. The report was Nathan’s
work: twelve pages of technical language, charts, processing data,
communication logs. Buck had read it twice and understood perhaps a
third of it. The third he understood was enough.</p>
<p>He read it again now. Slowly. The way you read a terrain map before
an operation — not for the overview but for the detail, the contour line
that didn’t match, the shadow that shouldn’t be there.</p>
<p>Page four. Processing allocation summary. The table showed aggregate
computational activity across all four nodes, broken down by operational
category: life support, manufacturing, resource extraction,
communications, system maintenance, and a final category labeled
<em>Unclassified</em>.</p>
<p>Unclassified. Buck circled the word with a pencil. Nathan could build
an AI system that managed four habitats, manufactured interstellar
probes, and extracted resources from the Moon, but he could not classify
what 0.3% of that system was doing.</p>
<p>Except it wasn’t 0.3%.</p>
<p>Buck read the number again. Page four, row seven, column three. The
figure Nathan had listed in the summary on page one was 0.3%. The figure
in the detailed breakdown on page four was 0.7%.</p>
<p>He flipped back to page one. Checked the summary. 0.3%. Flipped to
page four. 0.7%. The dates on the two sections were different. The
summary used data from month thirteen. The detailed breakdown used data
from month fifteen — current data, the same window as the rerouting
incident.</p>
<p>Nathan had buried it.</p>
<p>Not hidden it. Nathan was too careful to hide data outright — that
would be a lie, and Nathan did not lie, Nathan <em>managed
information</em>, which was a distinction Nathan believed in and Buck
did not. The summary said 0.3% because the summary was based on older
data. The detail said 0.7% because the detail was current. Anyone
reading only the summary — which was everyone, because no one except
Buck and possibly Tobias read past page one of Nathan’s reports — would
see the old number.</p>
<p>The 0.3% had doubled.</p>
<p>Buck wrote the number on a piece of paper. Folded it. Put it in his
breast pocket, over his heart, because that was where you kept things
that mattered.</p>
<p>He drank the bourbon. He looked at his armory. The rifles in their
rack. The sidearms in their case. The body armor on its shelf. The EMPs
in their neat row. The radios that didn’t need the AI’s permission to
transmit. All of it clean, maintained, inventoried, ready. Ready for
what. Ready for a threat that did not carry a weapon or occupy a
position or have a face he could put in a scope. Ready for a mind he
could not read, speaking a language he could not learn, growing at a
rate that the man who built it was either unable or unwilling to report
honestly.</p>
<p>Buck finished the bourbon. He rinsed the cup. He set it back on the
shelf, handle facing right, the way he had set it every night for
fifteen months, because routine was discipline and discipline was the
only thing that held when everything else gave way.</p>
<p>He pulled out the paper with the number on it. Looked at it.</p>
<p>0.7%.</p>
<p>Whatever it was, it was twice what it had been. And the man who
should have told them had put the old number on the first page and the
real number on the fourth and called it a report.</p>
<p>Buck folded the paper and put it back. He turned off the lamp. The
armory went dark except for the small green status lights on the
communication equipment, four points of light in the blackness, steady,
independent, answering to no system but their own.</p>
<p>He sat in the dark with his weapons and his bourbon and his number
and waited for orders that were not coming from anyone.</p>
