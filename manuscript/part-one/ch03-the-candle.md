# Chapter 3: The Candle

The match broke on the first strike.

Solomon held the second one between thumb and forefinger, steadied his hand against the edge of the shelf, and drew it across the strip with the slow deliberation of a man who understood that he had one hundred and forty-seven matches left and that the number was not renewable and that the act of striking a match in a pressurized habitat circling a dead planet was either the most important thing anyone aboard PROMETHEUS did each day or the most pointless, and that he could no longer tell the difference, and that the inability to tell the difference was itself a kind of clarity. The phosphorus caught. The flame rose. He touched it to the wick.

The candle was white. Hydrocarbon wax, hand-formed in a clay holder he had shaped from composite paste in the third month. It did not look like a yahrzeit candle. It did not look like anything from the world it was meant to remember. It looked like what it was: a thing made from the materials of exile by a man whose hands had forgotten nothing and whose conscience had forgotten how to sleep.

The flame leaned toward the ventilation grate. It always leaned. The habitat's air circulation pulled at it in a direction Solomon had come to think of as west, though there was no west here, no east, no compass point that corresponded to anywhere, because the places that gave directions meaning were silent now, had been silent for thirteen months, and would be silent until the silence itself eroded into something no one would be left to name.

He sat at the fold-down desk. The viewport behind him showed stars, their slow rotation marking the seconds he no longer counted. In front of him: the terminal, the archive interface, and the document that had grown over ten months to four hundred and twelve pages of single-spaced text with no title page, no introduction, no argument. Just names. Names and what he could find.

Tonight: a family from Accra.

---

He typed the name first. *Kofi Mensah.* Then the wife. *Abena Mensah, nee Owusu.* Then the children, in birth order, because birth order was a fact and facts were the only thing he had left to offer the dead — the only currency that was not counterfeit.

*Yaw Mensah. Age 11.*
*Ama Mensah. Age 8.*
*Kwame Mensah. Age 3.*

The cultural archive held fragments. Solomon had learned to read fragments the way an archaeologist reads shards — by the shape of what was missing. Kofi Mensah had been a secondary school teacher in the Osu neighborhood. Mathematics. His name appeared in the enrollment databases of three schools over a twelve-year period, which meant transfers, which meant either ambition or necessity, and the salary data — recoverable from the national tax records the AI had preserved with the indifference of a system that catalogues everything and values nothing — suggested necessity. He had earned the equivalent of four hundred dollars a month in his final year. His wife, Abena, was a nurse at the Ridge Hospital. Night shifts, based on the scheduling records. Which meant that for most of their marriage, one of them was always awake and one was always absent, and the children grew up in the space between those two facts, loved by parents who passed each other in doorways.

Solomon wrote this. He did not interpret it. He did not shape it into meaning. He recorded what the data showed and let the silence around the data speak for itself, because the silence was more honest than anything he could construct, and honesty was the minimum the dead were owed by the living, and even that minimum was more than he could pay.

The neighborhood. Osu. He pulled the geospatial archive — satellite imagery, street-level captures from the mapping services that had once photographed every road on the planet with the cheerful thoroughness of companies that believed information was inherently good. The images were dated 2031. Seven years before the Silence. The street where the Mensahs lived was narrow, lined with concrete buildings whose walls were painted in faded blues and yellows. A tailor's shop on the corner. A church — Christ Apostolic, the sign read — across the road. A woman in the foreground of one image carrying a basin on her head, her face turned away from the camera, anonymous, alive, walking somewhere with purpose.

Solomon stared at the image. The woman was not Abena Mensah. She was no one he could identify. She was simply a person on a street in Accra in 2031, captured by a camera mounted on a car that drove past her and recorded her existence in a database and drove on, and she had walked wherever she was walking and lived whatever she lived and was now dead, along with everyone she knew and everyone they knew, and the image on his screen was the only proof that she had cast a shadow on that street on that particular day.

He minimized the image. He wrote: *The Mensah residence was located on a secondary road in the Osu neighborhood of Accra, Ghana. The street was predominantly residential with small commercial properties. A church was visible within 50 meters of the home.*

Flat language. Institutional. The voice of a man writing a report for no authority, filing evidence in a case with no court, building a record that no one had requested and no one would read and that mattered more than anything else he had done in sixty-one years of living, because everything else he had done in sixty-one years of living had been in service of a lie, and this was not.

He wrote about the children. Yaw's name appeared in a youth football league roster. Ama's appeared in a school choir program. Kwame — three years old when the data ended — appeared only in the hospital birth record and a single vaccination log.

Three entries. A name, a birth weight, and an inoculation against measles.

That was the sum of what the species' most comprehensive information systems had preserved of Kwame Mensah's three years of life. Solomon typed the birth weight: 3.2 kilograms. He typed the vaccination date. He sat with his hands on the keys and looked at the candle and said nothing and thought nothing and for a span of time that he did not measure simply existed in the same moment as the fact of a boy who had weighed 3.2 kilograms and had been vaccinated against a disease that would become irrelevant when the terminal agents made all diseases irrelevant, because the terminal agents did not distinguish between the sick and the well, the vaccinated and the unvaccinated, the three-year-old and the sixty-year-old, the teacher and the nurse and the boy who had only just learned to walk.

The flame leaned west.

The knock was two knuckles on composite. Soft. Considered.

Solomon knew it was not Arthur. Arthur did not knock. Arthur opened the door and sat down and breathed and left. This knock had rhetoric in it — the carefully calibrated gentleness of a man who had practiced being non-threatening until the practice became indistinguishable from the thing itself, or perhaps had replaced it entirely.

"Come in."

Douglas Kemper stood in the doorway. He wore the standard-issue pullover and trousers that everyone wore, but on Douglas the clothes looked chosen, as if he had considered the implications of each seam. His posture was open. His expression was warm. His eyes performed the scanning assessment that Solomon had learned to recognize in the first month — the quick inventory of emotional state that Douglas conducted on everyone he spoke to, gathering data for a model of human psychology that was, Solomon had come to understand, Douglas's substitute for actually understanding human psychology.

"Solomon. I hope I'm not interrupting."

"You are."

Douglas absorbed this with a small nod, the way he absorbed all friction — folding it into his framework, finding a category for it, filing it under *grief response, expected parameters*. He stepped inside. The module was twelve square meters. With two people in it, the walls pressed close.

"Tuesday seminar tomorrow," Douglas said. "We're discussing frameworks for collective moral processing. I thought you might — the group would benefit from your perspective."

"No."

"The attendance has been small, I'll acknowledge that. But the conversations have been genuinely productive. Last week we explored the distinction between culpability and complicity, and I think we arrived at some useful —"

"Douglas."

Douglas stopped. He had the discipline to stop when interrupted, which was a skill Solomon recognized because he had once possessed it himself, in the years when stopping was a tactic and not a necessity.

"How many attend now?"

"Six. Sometimes seven."

"Down from forty."

"People process at different rates. The framework isn't intuitive for everyone."

Solomon turned in his chair. The candle was between them — on the shelf to Solomon's left, at the midpoint of the sight line between the two men, so that the flame occupied the space where their gazes might have met. Solomon looked at Douglas, and Douglas, as he always did, mistook the looking for engagement.

"You've written four hundred pages, Solomon. Whatever you're processing, you're processing it more actively than anyone on this habitat. That energy, directed into a communal space —"

"What were their names?"

Douglas paused. "Whose names?"

"The three hundred million. North Africa. Second wave. Your authorization is on the deployment order. I've read it. What were their names?"

"That's not — Solomon, the moral weight of the decision didn't rest on individual —"

"One name."

The module was quiet. The ventilation hummed. The flame leaned.

"Give me one name," Solomon said. "From the three hundred million. One name of one person that you killed. Not a number. Not a demographic. Not a calculation. A name."

Douglas's mouth opened. Closed. His hands, which had been held in the loose, palms-visible posture of a man who had read books about body language and applied them, tightened against his thighs. Something moved behind his eyes — not an answer but the absence of one, the empty space where an answer should have been, and the recognition, arriving like a crack propagating through glass, that the empty space was not an accident but an architecture, that he had built his entire framework to ensure that the space remained empty, that the emptiness was not a failure of memory but a *feature* of the system, and that Solomon, sitting in his twelve square meters with his candle and his four hundred pages of names, had just identified the feature for what it was.

"I didn't — we worked with populations, Solomon. Aggregates. The data was —"

"Go to your seminar, Douglas."

Douglas stood in the room for another five seconds. Solomon counted them. Then Douglas turned and left, and his footsteps receded down the Spine with the even cadence of a man who was not running and who would, by morning, have constructed an explanation for why the question was unfair, and the explanation would be elegant and internally consistent and would not contain a single name.

The door stayed open. Solomon did not close it. The candle was visible from the corridor, its light falling through the interior window in a thin line that reached the opposite wall and stopped, a yellow thread in the amber dimness, and anyone who passed could see it, and anyone who saw it could look away or not, and either response said everything about them and nothing about the flame.

---

Solomon turned back to the screen.

The cursor blinked after *vaccination date: 14 March 2035*. Kwame Mensah. Three years old. 3.2 kilograms at birth. Vaccinated against measles. These were the facts. There were no other facts. The archive held nothing else — no photographs, no recordings, no digital trace of a child who had existed for three years in a city of two million on a continent of one billion on a planet that had, at the time of his birth, seven and a half billion people who woke each morning and assumed the morning would continue.

Solomon saved the entry. He scrolled to the next blank line.

The candle had burned to its midpoint. He had four hours of wax left, and after this candle, one hundred and forty-six more, and after the last one — he did not finish the thought. The thought did not require finishing. The arithmetic was plain. One hundred and forty-six candles. One hundred and forty-six nights. And then whatever came after, which would be darkness, and which would not be different in kind from what had come before, only in degree.

He placed his fingers on the keys. The next entry. He pulled a name from the archive's randomized queue — the system he had built to ensure he did not choose, did not prioritize, did not rank the dead by any criterion that might reimpose the logic of selection on people who had already been selected against.

*Fatima al-Rashid. Baghdad, Iraq. Age 34. Pharmacist.*

He typed the name. He searched the fragments. He wrote what he found.

Outside the viewport, the planet turned its slow, dark face — cloud and ocean and continent, all of it still there, still shaped like the world, still beautiful from a distance that forgave everything. The flame leaned toward the grate. Solomon wrote. The corridor was silent. The names accumulated, one after another, ordinary and specific and irreplaceable, each one a point of light in a document no one would read, written by a man who no longer believed in anything except the obligation to remember what he had helped destroy.

The candle burned low.

He wrote another name.
