# Chapter 1: The Eyes

Arthur Pendleton drew the baker from Marseille again — the third time this week, always from the same angle, always with flour on her hands — and still could not get the eyes right.

The charcoal moved across the synthetic paper in strokes he had long since stopped directing. His fingers knew the shape of this woman's face the way a pianist knows a nocturne: the crooked bridge of her nose, the asymmetric laugh lines, the faint scar above her left eyebrow where something — a cabinet door, a childhood fall, a story he would never know — had marked her. He had all of it. He had her.

He did not have her eyes.

He held the paper at arm's length. The studio — if a twelve-square-meter module half-buried in charcoal dust deserved the name — was lit by a single task lamp clamped to the fold-down desk. Everything beyond its cone of light existed in shades of gray: the walls, once white composite, now coated with a fine carbon film that made the room feel less like a dwelling than like the inside of a pencil; the stacked pages on the sleeping platform he rarely used for sleeping; the viewport, thirty centimeters of reinforced glass through which the stars performed their slow rotation, one full turn every thirty seconds, the only clock in the room that never lied.

The baker's eyes stared back at him from the page. They were technically correct. The proportions were right, the shading adequate, the lids and lashes rendered with the precision of a man who had drawn this face — and faces like it, four thousand and counting — every day for thirteen months. But correct was not the word he needed. Correct was a coffin with the right dimensions. What he needed was the thing that made a face a *face* and not a rendering, and he could not find it, and he did not know its name.

He set the page down on the stack of other failed attempts and rubbed his fingertips together. The charcoal had worked itself into the whorls of his prints long ago. His hands were permanently gray. Peggy had offered him solvent once, some concoction from her laboratory stores, and he had looked at her with an expression that made her withdraw the offer and not repeat it.

It was 0300. He knew this without checking. At 0300 the habitat achieved its closest approximation of stillness — not silence, never silence, because silence was something that existed on the planet below and nowhere else, but a diminishment of the human noise that during waking hours filled the corridors with footsteps and arguments and the sound of Edwin Hartwell explaining things to people who had stopped listening. At 0300 the reclamation system exhaled its steady mechanical breath through the ventilation grates, and the reactor hum transmitted itself through the structural bones of PROMETHEUS in a frequency too low to hear and too persistent to forget, and the occasional thermal contraction of a hull plate produced a sound like a knuckle cracking in an empty church.

Arthur stood. His knees protested. Seventy-nine years, even in seven-tenths gravity, accumulated in the joints.

He stepped into the Spine.

The main corridor ran the full five hundred meters of the habitat — three meters wide, two and a half meters tall, lit at this hour by the dim amber of the night cycle, which cast the kind of light that erased detail and left only shape. Arthur had walked this corridor at this hour almost every night since the third month, when the insomnia had resolved itself from affliction into routine. He walked slowly. There was nowhere to arrive.

The forward section held the Founders' quarters. Thirteen modules, port side, arranged in a row that everyone understood was hierarchical and no one acknowledged as such. Most of the doors were closed. Behind them, people who had ended a species slept or didn't sleep, dreamed or didn't dream, and the corridor kept their secrets with the indifference of all corridors everywhere.

Module F-01 was Edwin's. Light bled from the seam beneath the door — Edwin rarely slept before four, his internal clock still synced to an audience that no longer existed, still composing posts for a message board that twenty people checked out of habit and none checked out of interest. Arthur could hear the faint percussion of fingers on a keyboard. Edwin typing. Edwin explaining. Edwin performing the role of Edwin for an auditorium that seated one.

Arthur passed without stopping.

Module F-07 was Leonard's. The only door with an aftermarket lock, a small chrome cylinder that Leonard had fabricated in the second month with the quiet competence of a man who understood that the difference between safety and vulnerability was a mechanism you controlled yourself. No light beneath this door. Leonard slept, or wanted you to think he did.

Module F-11 was Solomon's. Arthur slowed.

Through the interior window — a narrow strip of glass that most residents had covered with paper or fabric for privacy — the candle was visible. A single flame, not much larger than a fingertip, burning in its clay holder on the shelf beside the viewport. Solomon made the candles himself from hydrocarbon wax requisitioned through channels that Tobias had chosen not to audit. One per day, every day, since the third month. The fire protocols listed open flame as a Category 2 hazard in a pressurized habitat. The protocols had not been enforced. Even Tobias understood that some hazards served a structural purpose, though the structure they served was not mechanical.

The flame moved. A draft from the ventilation — the candle always leaned slightly toward the vent, as if reaching for something outside the room. Arthur watched it for what might have been a minute or might have been longer. Time at 0300 lost its edges.

He and Solomon did not speak during their visits. They had not decided this; it had simply happened, the way ice forms on a window — not because anyone instructs it but because the conditions allow nothing else. Solomon would be writing at his desk, or sitting in his chair looking at the flame, and Arthur would enter and sit on the floor with his back against the wall, and they would remain like that for an hour, sometimes two, and then Arthur would leave, and neither of them would have said a word, and both of them would have said everything.

He moved on.

The Commons opened before him — the largest interior space on PROMETHEUS, thirty meters of tables and chairs and the faint residual smell of the evening meal, which tonight had been the usual: protein paste, reconstituted grain, hydroponic greens that tasted of nutrient solution and fluorescent light. The serving station was dark. The message board terminals mounted on the far wall glowed with their permanent blue-white insomnia, four rectangles of light in the dimness like windows into a room where someone was always awake.

Arthur approached the nearest terminal. He did not check the board — had not read it in months — but the light itself drew him the way Solomon's candle drew him, because light in a dark corridor was a kind of company, and company was a thing he no longer sought but could not entirely refuse.

The screen displayed Edwin's latest post. Arthur's eyes moved across the words without reading them. Something about probe trajectories. Something about timeline optimization. The language of a man still building the future in a habitat full of people who had forgotten how to want one.

Below Edwin's post, three responses. One from Tobias, procedural. One from Douglas, philosophical. One anonymous, two words long, which Arthur's eyes caught and held: *For whom?*

He turned away.

The east wall of the Commons held the names. Hundreds of them now, written in pigments that ranged from standard-issue marker to what appeared to be hydroponic nutrient fluid, which dried to a rusty brown that looked like what it was not and might as well have been. Maria. Ahmed. Yuki. Patrick. Amara. Chen. The handwriting varied — some careful, some desperate, some so small you had to press your face to the wall to read them. No one had claimed authorship. No one had organized it. The wall had simply accumulated, the way grief accumulates, without permission and without end.

Arthur stood before it. He did not read the names. He knew them — not these specific names, but the weight of them, the aggregate fact of them, which was the same fact his portraits tried to counter: that nine billion individual human beings had been reduced to a number, and the number had been weighed against a theory, and the theory had won, and the theory was his.

He had written the paper. Thirty years ago. "On the Obligation of Seed Intelligence." Forty-seven pages of mathematically elegant, philosophically rigorous argument for the proposition that the universe was too large to be empty and that filling it was worth any price. He had believed it with the purity of a man who had spent his life contemplating scale — billions of galaxies, trillions of stars, distances so vast that light itself grew old crossing them — and who had concluded that anything small enough to hold in your hand, including a human life, was a rounding error in the calculation of cosmic purpose.

He no longer believed it. He had not announced this. He had simply stopped saying "necessary," and the absence of the word had grown louder than anything he might have said in its place.

The corridor back to his module was two hundred meters of amber dimness and the hum that never stopped. His footsteps were the only human sound. At 0300, in a habitat designed for ten thousand and occupied by two hundred, the emptiness was not metaphorical. It was architectural. The unused sections branched off the Spine at regular intervals — sealed doors, dark corridors, modules maintained in standby by an AI that did not understand the concept of "too much room" and would keep the temperature at twenty-one degrees and the atmosphere at 0.85 bar in spaces no one would ever enter, because that was its function, and it performed its function, and whether anyone was there to breathe the air was not its concern.

Or so they had assumed.

Arthur reached his module. The door was open — he never closed it, because closing it implied that what was inside needed protecting, and what was inside was charcoal and paper and a man who had authored the intellectual framework for the extinction of his species, and none of these things were worth a lock.

The portraits covered every surface. Walls, sleeping platform, desk, floor in stacks three and four deep. Four thousand faces. Four thousand pairs of eyes that were technically correct and spiritually empty, each one a precise failure, each one proof that you could reconstruct a human face from archival data with absolute fidelity and still miss the thing that made it human.

He had drawn children and grandmothers and young men with uncertain smiles and old women with certain ones. He had drawn a street vendor in Lagos whose hands, even in charcoal, suggested the particular roughness of a life spent gripping things. He had drawn a cellist in Prague whose posture, even in stillness, carried the memory of music. He had drawn faces from every continent, every age, every variation of the human template, and in every one of them the eyes were wrong.

Not wrong in any way he could name. Not wrong in proportion, or placement, or the rendering of light on the curved surface of the cornea. Wrong in the way that a perfect replica of a loved one's voice, generated by a machine, is wrong — technically flawless and fundamentally dead. The eyes in his portraits looked at nothing. The eyes in the archive footage had looked at *everything* — at the person holding the camera, at the street beyond the frame, at the future they assumed would arrive, at the specific and unrepeatable moment of their own existence. His charcoal could not capture this. His charcoal could capture the shape of an eye. It could not capture the fact of being seen.

Arthur sat down in the only clear space, a square of floor between the desk and the viewport. He picked up a fresh sheet of paper. He picked up the charcoal.

The baker from Marseille. Fourth attempt. Same angle. Flour on her hands.

He drew the nose first — the crooked bridge, the small asymmetry that made her face hers and not anyone else's. Then the jaw, the forehead, the laugh lines that deepened when she smiled, which she did in the footage, a wide and unself-conscious smile directed at someone outside the frame, someone she knew, someone she was glad to see.

He reached the eyes and stopped.

The charcoal hovered. The paper waited. Through the viewport the stars turned their slow, indifferent wheel.

Arthur drew the eyes.

They were wrong.

He set the portrait on the stack with the others, gently, the way you lay a body down when the body is no longer occupied but the shape of it still matters. He looked at his hands. Gray with carbon. Mapped with the veins of seventy-nine years. These hands had written the paper. These hands had shaken Edwin's hand at the Montana meeting in 2017 and sealed the future of the species with a handshake and a shared delusion about the moral weight of stars.

These hands drew the dead now. One face at a time. And could not get the eyes right.

He picked up the charcoal.

He began again.
