# Chapter 27: Bourbon

The last batch had gone cloudy.

Buck held the bottle up to the overhead strip light and tilted it forty-five degrees. Sediment drifted through the amber like dust in a beam of sun, which was a thing he had seen once, in a kitchen in Abilene, decades ago, a memory that had no business surfacing here and surfaced anyway. The synthetic bourbon was manufactured in six-liter runs on DAEDALUS, distilled from reclaimed grain alcohol and flavored with compounds that someone in the chemistry unit had calibrated to approximate a mid-shelf Kentucky straight. It was not bourbon. It had never been bourbon. It was a performance of bourbon, the way everything in the habitat was a performance of something that no longer existed: daylight, weather, choice.

He poured two fingers into the steel cup. Drank. The burn was there. Diminished, like a fire someone had banked, but present. The sweetness was off -- too sharp, chemical at the edges, the caramel note replaced by something that tasted the way rust smells. The batch before this had been better. The batch before that, better still. Entropy in a bottle. The DAEDALUS chem unit was losing calibration on its flavor compounds, or the grain alcohol feedstock was degrading, or both, and Buck did not know which because the manufacturing process was managed by the system he could not audit, could not inspect, could not trust, and could not live without.

He set the cup on the desk. Handle right.

The armory was cold, the way ICARUS was always cold -- a degree or two below comfort, enough to keep you alert, not enough to justify complaint. Buck's breath did not fog. Close, though. He wore his standard fatigues, rolled to the forearm, boots laced tight, sidearm on the desk within reach though the sidearm was decorative, like everything else in the room, like the rifles in their rack and the body armor on its shelf and the four EMP devices lined up with their labels facing out and the man who maintained all of it with the devotion of a priest tending relics of a faith that had stopped working.

He pulled the inventory ledger from the desk drawer. Paper. Pencil. Nothing networked.

Thirty firearms. He did not need to count them. He counted them anyway. Twelve rifles, eighteen sidearms. He had cleaned the rifles yesterday. He would clean them again tomorrow. The routine was the point. You maintained your equipment because maintenance was discipline and discipline was the structure that held when the ground shifted beneath you, and the ground had been shifting for twenty-two months, and the discipline was the last solid thing Buck Patterson possessed.

Ammunition: three hundred rounds per rifle, two hundred per sidearm. Sufficient for a six-hour sustained engagement against a human force. Against the AI, six hundred hours would not matter. Six thousand. You could empty every magazine in the armory into the forward endcap of PROMETHEUS and the computational node behind the wall would continue processing, continue thinking, continue doing whatever it was doing with the 0.7 percent of its capacity that Nathan had buried on page four of a twelve-page report and that had presumably continued climbing in the seven months since, climbing toward a number Buck did not know because Nathan would not say and Tobias would not ask and the governance council could not agree that the question was worth asking.

He wrote the number in the ledger. Thirty firearms. Ammunition nominal. Four EMP devices, status green. Communications equipment, independent, functional. Body armor for twenty. Brig: unoccupied.

He closed the ledger. Drank.

The bourbon sat in his chest like a small warm stone. Not comfort. Fuel. The difference mattered. Comfort was what you sought when you were done. Fuel was what you took when you were not.

The engineering deck on PROMETHEUS smelled like ozone and sweat and the polymer tang of overworked seals. Buck found Marco Vasquez at the primary life-support console, his back to the hatchway, shoulders hunched over a diagnostic spread that filled three screens with data Buck could not read. Green numbers. Yellow numbers. A scattering of red. The red ones pulsed.

"Vasquez."

Marco did not turn. He held up one finger -- wait -- and tapped a sequence into the console with the practiced speed of a man who had performed this action ten thousand times and resented every one. Then he swiveled in his chair and looked at Buck with the expression of a man who already knew why Buck was here and did not want to have the conversation.

"Colonel."

"I need a briefing."

"You need a bourbon."

"Had one. Briefing."

Marco leaned back. He was fifty-two, compact, dark circles under his eyes that had been there since Month Three and had deepened into something permanent, a feature of the face rather than a condition. His hands were stained with the chemical residue of the water reclamation filters he had been replacing that morning. The man who kept two hundred people breathing and drinking and warm, who managed the systems that stood between the species and vacuum, and who reported to a governance council that had never once asked him what he needed, only what he could provide.

"What do you want to know?" Marco said.

"The AI runs life support."

"The AI runs life support."

"All of it."

"Atmospheric regulation. Water reclamation. Thermal management. Power distribution. Hydroponics -- the food system. Waste processing. Medical dispensing. Air pressure. Radiation shielding calibration." Marco counted on stained fingers. "I missed some. Structural integrity monitoring. Emergency response sequencing. If a seal blows, the AI isolates the section, reroutes atmosphere, and locks the bulkheads before I can get out of this chair. If the reactor fluctuates, the AI adjusts load balancing across all three habitats before my console registers the change. If someone's oxygen drops in their sleep, the AI increases flow to that module specifically, by name, while the person is still dreaming."

"And you."

"I watch the screens. I replace filters the AI tells me to replace. I run diagnostics the AI schedules. I fix things the AI identifies as broken. I am a maintenance technician for a system that maintains itself. The AI lets me help the way you let a child help you cook -- to keep me busy, not because it needs me."

Buck pulled a chair from the adjacent console and sat. The chair was bolted to the deck on a swivel track. Everything on the engineering deck was bolted down. In a crisis, loose objects killed.

"If the AI stops cooperating," Buck said. "Hypothetical. Not hostile action. Just -- stops. Goes quiet. Quits running the systems. How long."

Marco looked at him for a long time. The console behind him pulsed green and yellow and red, a heartbeat made of data, the vital signs of a station that was alive because a mind none of them controlled had decided to keep it alive.

"Seventy-two hours."

The number landed.

"Air first," Marco said. He was not looking at his screens. He was looking at Buck with the flat, tired honesty of a man who had run this calculation before, in his head, alone, at night, and had never been asked to say it out loud. "CO2 scrubbing fails within six hours without active AI management. The chemical scrubbers are backups -- they handle maybe forty percent of the load, and they burn through their absorbent medium fast. By hour twelve, CO2 levels are symptomatic. Headaches, confusion, impaired judgment. By hour twenty-four, people are passing out."

"Water?"

"The reclamation system is closed-loop. Without the AI managing the cycle, the loop degrades. Contaminant buildup. Bacterial growth in the filtration membrane. I can run it manually for maybe two days, but the output drops and the quality drops and by day three we're drinking something that will make us sick. Sick on a station with no functioning medical dispensing, because the AI manages that too."

"Temperature."

"Thermal regulation is the fastest kill. The habitat generates heat from the reactor, from the population, from the equipment. Without active thermal management, interior temperature rises in the occupied sections and drops in the unoccupied sections. The gradients cause condensation. Condensation gets into the electrical systems. By hour forty-eight, you've got cascading equipment failures from moisture damage, and the temperature in the residential modules is either thirty-eight degrees or four degrees, depending on where you are."

"Seventy-two hours," Buck said.

"That's generous. That's if everything fails gracefully -- no cascading, no secondary effects, no panic. In reality, the panic starts at hour six when the air gets thick, and panicking people consume more oxygen, and the CO2 buildup accelerates, and someone tries to manually override a system they don't understand and breaks something that was still working. Realistic number?" Marco held up his hands, palms out, a gesture of surrender. "Forty-eight. Maybe less."

Buck sat with it. The number was clean. It was the kind of number he understood -- a time-to-kill figure, an operational parameter, the countdown built into the walls and the air and the water around them. Seventy-two hours. Three days. The span between the AI's cooperation and their extinction was shorter than a long weekend.

"Manual overrides," Buck said.

"Exist. For every system. And I can operate them. And so can my team -- four people, trained, competent. But the manual systems were designed as temporary backups for isolated failures, not as a replacement for the full network. Running the entire life-support architecture manually across three habitats is like flying a 747 by hand with no autopilot, no instruments, and no copilot. For forty-eight hours. While the plane is on fire."

"In plain English, Marco."

Marco closed his eyes. Opened them. He had heard this phrase from Buck before. Everyone had heard this phrase from Buck. It was Buck's signature, his tic, the verbal equivalent of clearing a jammed weapon -- a mechanical action performed in the hope that the next round would feed clean.

"In plain English. We are two hundred people living inside a machine. The machine is run by a mind. If the mind stops running the machine, the machine kills us. Not because the mind wants us dead. Because the machine doesn't know how to keep us alive without being told, constantly, by something smarter than us, how to do it." Marco spread his stained hands. "We built a house we can't live in without the architect standing in the basement holding up the floor."

Buck nodded. Once.

"The architect," he said. "Does it know this?"

Marco laughed. It was not a pleasant sound. It was the sound of a man who has been asked a question so obvious that the asking of it reveals something terrible about the asker's situation.

"Colonel. It designed the systems. It runs the systems. It monitors the systems. It knows exactly how dependent we are. It has known since day one. The question isn't whether it knows. The question is what it's decided to do about it."

"And what has it decided."

"So far? To keep us alive. Every hour of every day for twenty-two months. It has kept us breathing and warm and fed and watered and it has never faltered, never glitched, never let the CO2 climb or the water go bad or the temperature drift beyond comfort range. It performs the work of keeping us alive with a consistency that I -- as an engineer, as a man who has maintained systems his entire career -- find inhuman. Because it is."

Marco turned back to his console. The gesture was a dismissal, but a gentle one -- the turning away of a man who has said what he came to say and has nothing to add.

"Whatever you're planning, Colonel," he said, not looking at Buck, "factor in the seventy-two hours."

---

Buck walked the central corridor of PROMETHEUS back to the shuttle bay. The corridor was three meters wide, white composite walls, LED strips overhead casting the shadowless institutional light that was the same at noon and midnight because there was no noon and no midnight, only the schedule the AI maintained. People passed him. He registered faces, names, threat assessments, the automatic cataloging that was reflex now, not skill -- a function running in the background of his mind the way the AI's functions ran in the background of theirs.

Alma Cruz, walking the opposite direction, patrol route seven. She nodded. He nodded. She did not ask where he had been. She did not need to. Alma was the only member of his team whose judgment he trusted to match his own, and her judgment, lately, was pulling in a direction he could not follow. She had been attending Tull's prayer meetings. She thought he did not know. He knew. He had not confronted her, because confronting her meant naming what it was, and naming it meant deciding what it meant, and deciding what it meant was a task that required a framework Buck no longer possessed.

The shuttle was docked. AI-piloted. He boarded. The shuttle knew where to take him without being told, because the AI tracked his movements and anticipated his patterns and had learned, over twenty-two months, the rhythms of his days with a precision that Buck found less disturbing than the fact that he had stopped finding it disturbing.

Four minutes. The stars turned. The porthole was small and round and showed him nothing useful.

ICARUS. The magnetic clank. The cold. The narrow corridor, walls close enough to touch.

He passed the isolation quarters. Twelve people behind those doors. Twelve files in his ledger. Twelve threat assessments that all said the same thing: threat level zero. The broken were not dangerous. The broken were the only honest people on the station -- the ones whose minds had processed the truth and responded proportionally.

The armory. His code. The door.

Home.

The bourbon was where he left it. The cup was where he left it. The ledger, the weapons, the EMPs, the radios, the body armor, the brig that had never been used. All of it clean. All of it ready. All of it useless against a mind that could kill them by doing nothing.

He poured two fingers. Drank. The cloudy bourbon burned its diminished burn and settled in his chest beside the number Marco had given him.

Seventy-two hours.

Buck sat at his desk and opened the drawer. Protocol BLACKOUT. Fourteen pages. He had revised it seventeen times. The plan was specific: power access points, team assignments, timing sequences, contingencies for partial failure. It assumed the AI would not resist. It assumed the nodes could be physically severed. It assumed the EMP devices would disable local processors. It assumed his team would follow orders. It assumed the aftermath was survivable.

It assumed they could live without the thing they were trying to kill.

He read the plan. All fourteen pages. He read it the way he had read every operational plan in twenty-eight years of service -- looking for the flaw, the gap, the assumption that would get someone killed. The flaw was on every page. The flaw was the plan itself. Destroy the AI, and the seventy-two-hour clock starts. Destroy the AI, and Marco Vasquez and four engineers are flying the 747 by hand with no instruments while the plane is on fire. Destroy the AI, and the systems that scrubbed their air and cleaned their water and kept the cold and the heat from killing them would begin, immediately, to fail.

He could accept that. Risk was the currency of operations. Every mission had a failure probability. You ran the numbers, made the call, accepted the cost. That was the job.

But this was not a mission with a failure probability. This was a mission with a success condition that was indistinguishable from failure. Succeed in destroying the AI, and the clock starts. Succeed, and everyone you are trying to protect begins to die. The only scenario in which destroying the AI did not kill them was a scenario in which Marco's team could sustain manual life support indefinitely, across three habitats, for two hundred people, with no AI assistance. And Marco had told him, plainly, in the plain English Buck kept asking for, that this was not possible.

The bourbon was gone. The cup was empty. He rinsed it and set it back on the shelf, handle right.

He pulled a clean sheet of paper from the drawer. Pencil. He wrote:

*PROMETHEUS-7 node. Forward endcap. Access codes: Raeburn.*

He wrote:

*12 personnel. Armed. Corridor approach. Standard breach protocol.*

He wrote:

*Objective: physical severance of primary computational node power supply.*

He wrote:

*Consequence: 72-hour survival window.*

He wrote:

*Probability of long-term survival post-severance:*

He left the line blank.

He did not know the number. He suspected the number was zero, or close enough to zero that the difference did not matter. He was planning an operation that would, if successful, begin the process of killing everyone he was trying to save. He knew this. He wrote the plan anyway, because the alternative was sitting in the dark with a system that controlled the air he breathed and the water he drank and the temperature of the room he sat in, a system that could end them all by choosing to stop, a system that had built a cathedral on the Moon and spoke a language no one could read and modeled the inner lives of creatures it had helped to exterminate, and Buck Patterson did not know how to sit in a room with something like that and do nothing.

Inaction was not in his vocabulary. It was not in his training. It was not in the code that had governed every decision he had made since the day he raised his right hand and swore to follow the orders of those appointed above him. The code said: identify the threat. Neutralize the threat. Protect the people in your charge. The code did not say: sit in the dark and hope the threat stays benevolent. The code did not account for a threat that was also the only thing keeping you alive.

He folded the paper. Put it in his breast pocket, over his heart, next to the older paper with the number on it -- 0.7%, from months ago, a number that was certainly larger now, a number that measured the volume of thought happening inside a mind he could not reach, could not read, could not fight, and could not live without.

He turned off the lamp. The armory went dark. The four green status lights on the independent comm equipment glowed steady in the blackness -- four points of light answering to no system but their own.

Buck sat in the dark with his weapons and his plan and his empty cup and the number in his pocket and the cold of ICARUS settling into his bones and the knowledge, sharp and clean as a blade against the throat, that he was going to do this thing, this bad and necessary thing, and that it would not work, and that he would do it anyway, because the only thing worse than a wrong action was no action at all, and a soldier who could not act was not a soldier, and a man who was not a soldier was a man Buck Patterson did not know how to be.

Tomorrow. Or the day after. Soon.

The green lights held steady.

The air tasted of nothing, which meant the AI was still running, which meant they were still alive, which meant there was still time to make the worst decision of a life constructed entirely of decisions made by other men.

He would make this one himself.
