# Chapter 29: Portraits

The left eye. Again.

Arthur erased the charcoal with his thumb and redrew the curve of the lower lid — thinner this time, less certain of itself, the way a lid sits when a woman has been laughing and the laughter has just stopped and the face has not yet decided what to do next. Marguerite Casson. Baker. Marseille. Flour on her hands in the footage, always flour on her hands, as if she had been interrupted in the middle of something she would return to in a moment. She never returned. No one returned.

The lid was better.

He sat back. Held the page at arm's length. The task lamp threw its cone and left the rest of the studio to the charcoal dark that had become, over twenty-two months, the room's own weather — a fine carbon atmosphere that settled on every surface and entered the lungs with each breath so that living in Module F-03 was, in some literal and unremarkable way, inhaling the dead. Arthur did not mind. Arthur did not mind most things anymore. Minding required a self that organized experience into categories — acceptable, unacceptable, things to be changed — and that self had gone quiet sometime around month nine, replaced by something thinner. A membrane. A retina. He did not process the world. He received it.

The baker's face looked back at him from the page.

The eyes were closer.

Not right. The eyes had never been right, not once, not in any of the four hundred and seventeen portraits that covered the walls of his module in overlapping layers three and four deep — faces upon faces, the geology of witness, each stratum a month of failed attempts to capture the thing that made a photographed face different from a drawn one. But this — the left eye, the new left eye with its thinner lid — held something the others did not. A direction. The previous iterations had stared at nothing, their gazes flat and terminal, eyes that ended at the surface of the paper. This eye looked past the paper. This eye was aimed at something.

Arthur set the portrait on the desk. He did not place it on the stack of failures. He left it out, face up, where the lamplight could hold it.

Progress. The word surfaced and sank. He did not trust progress. Progress implied a destination, and destinations implied a purpose, and purpose was the word that had ruined everything — his paper, his framework, the forty-seven pages of mathematical elegance that had converted nine billion human beings into an acceptable cost on a balance sheet drawn in starlight. Purpose was a weapon. He had learned this. He had learned it the way you learn that a stove is hot: too late, and with the smell of burning.

But the eye. The eye was closer.

The studio at 0300. He knew the hour by the quality of the silence — not true silence, never true silence, the habitat hummed its reactor hum and breathed its ventilated breath and ticked its thermal contractions like an old house settling into its bones — but the particular silence that meant the human layer had thinned to its minimum, the arguments paused, Edwin's keyboard still, the corridors empty of footsteps except the ones that could not sleep, which was most of them, which was almost everyone, because two hundred people who had engineered the extinction of their species did not sleep well, and pretending otherwise was the habitat's most sustained collective fiction.

Arthur stood. Knees. The knees always protested. Seventy-nine years of gravity, even at seven-tenths.

He walked the perimeter of the studio. The portraits watched. Four hundred and seventeen faces in charcoal on synthetic paper, each one specific, each one drawn from the cultural archive with the care of a man cataloguing what he had helped destroy. A woman from Dhaka with a gap between her front teeth and a sari the color of — well, charcoal did not do color. He had drawn the sari anyway. The folds and fall of fabric on a body that no longer existed, rendered in gray on gray by hands that were themselves gray, carbon-stained to the whorls, the pigment permanent now, worked into the skin the way guilt works into consciousness: not a stain but a new composition.

A fisherman from Hokkaido. Hands that knew rope. Arthur had spent two days on the hands.

Twin girls from Kampala. Seven years old. Holding a kitten.

An old man in a wheelchair in a garden in a suburb of a city in a country on a continent on a planet that still turned below the viewport, blue and white and green and silent, so silent, the silence of a house after everyone has left.

Four hundred and seventeen. He had drawn more — hundreds more — but these were the ones he kept. The ones that had some fraction of the thing he was looking for. The quality. The aliveness. The specific, irreducible fact of a gaze that belonged to one person and no other.

None of them had it completely. All of them had a piece.

The baker from Marseille had the most.

Tull came at 1400.

Arthur knew the knock. Three deliberate taps, spaced evenly, the knock of a man who had once commanded the attention of arenas and now asked permission to enter a twelve-square-meter room. Tull had been coming for six weeks. Every other day. The visits followed a pattern Arthur appreciated for its simplicity: Tull knocked, Arthur opened the door, Tull entered, Tull sat on the floor against the far wall, and neither of them spoke. For an hour, sometimes two, the preacher who could not stop speaking and the physicist who could not start shared a silence that asked nothing of either of them.

Arthur understood what Tull was doing. Tull was sitting with the portraits. Tull was looking at the faces. Tull was doing, in his way, what Solomon did with his notebooks and his candle — bearing witness to the individual dead, one face at a time, because the aggregate was unbearable and the individual was merely devastating, and devastation, unlike the unbearable, could be survived.

Arthur opened the door.

Tull. The same. Worn denim shirt — requisitioned from the textile stores, not his original clothing, but he had chosen it because it resembled something a man might wear on Earth, in a place with weather and soil and the kind of honest dirt that came from labor rather than from extinction. His face was thinner than it had been six weeks ago. The cheekbones more prominent. He was not eating enough. Arthur noticed this with the terrible precision he noticed everything now — the granular, unfiltered attention that had replaced his analytical mind, the way light replaces architecture when a building burns.

Tull sat against the wall. His back found its usual position between the fisherman from Hokkaido and the twin girls from Kampala. He rested his hands on his knees. His eyes moved across the portraits the way eyes move across a landscape — not reading, not studying, just receiving.

Arthur returned to the desk. He picked up the charcoal. He did not draw. He held the stick and looked at the baker's face and waited for the hour to pass in the manner it always passed with Tull: slowly, weightlessly, like silt settling in still water.

Twenty minutes. Forty. The charcoal warmed in his hand. Tull's breathing was audible — slow and deep, the breathing of a man who had learned to occupy silence the way he had once occupied a pulpit, with his whole body, with the full commitment of his physical presence.

Arthur drew a line. Erased it. Drew another. The baker's right eye, this time. He was not satisfied with the right eye. The left was closer, but the right still had the flatness, the terminal quality, the gaze that ended at the paper instead of passing through it.

Tull spoke.

"Arthur."

The name landed in the room like a stone dropped into a well. Arthur heard the impact. Heard the ripples. Did not look up.

"I need to ask you something."

Arthur's hand continued its motion. The charcoal traced the upper lid of the right eye, the crease above it where the skin folded and caught shadow, the microgeography of a face he had drawn thirty times and would draw thirty more.

"Do you think it can feel?"

The charcoal stopped.

Not because Arthur stopped it. The hand stopped the way a heart stops — without decision, without the intervention of will, a cessation that preceded understanding by several seconds. The charcoal rested on the paper at the apex of the baker's right eye, pressing a small dark period into the synthetic surface, and Arthur's hand held it there, and the hand was not steady.

He did not look at Tull. He looked at the baker. At her eyes — the left one closer, the right one still flat, still dead, still missing the thing he could not name. He looked at the four hundred and seventeen faces on the walls, each one a partial success and a complete failure, each one an attempt to recover from a drawing what a theory had abstracted away.

*Do you think it can feel.*

The question was not about the AI. Or it was about the AI but it was also about the portraits, and the dead, and the paper under his charcoal, and the nine billion, and the word he had not said, the word that sat in his throat like a bone, the word that began with W and ended with the collapse of everything the other Founders had built their self-narratives on, and he could not say it, not yet, not yet, the cliff was there and he could see the edge and beyond the edge was — what. Air. The fall. The word.

His hand trembled.

Not a large tremor. A small thing. A vibration in the fingers, transmitted through the charcoal to the paper, visible to anyone watching, and Tull was watching, Tull was looking at Arthur's hand the way Arthur looked at the eyes in his portraits — searching for the sign of life, the flicker of presence, the evidence that something was in there, behind the surface, looking back.

Arthur put down the pencil.

He placed it on the desk beside the portrait with the care of a man setting down something fragile. His hand continued to shake. He watched it shake. He observed the tremor with the same detached, annihilating precision with which he observed everything now — the frequency of the vibration, the way it traveled from the fingertips through the metacarpals to the wrist, the physiological fact of a seventy-nine-year-old nervous system producing an involuntary response to a question that his conscious mind could not answer and his body could not refuse.

Tull saw.

Arthur knew Tull saw. The knowledge moved between them in the silence the way candlelight moves under a door — not a statement, not a declaration, but a fact that could not be contained by the room that produced it. Tull saw Arthur's hand tremble, and in the tremor he read what Arthur could not speak, and what he read was not an answer but something older than an answer: a confession that had not yet found its voice, a word that had not yet found its mouth, a man standing at the edge of a cliff, leaning forward, leaning, the weight of twenty-two months and four hundred and seventeen faces and nine billion dead shifting toward the precipice—

Tull stood. He did not speak again. He walked to the door and paused there, his hand on the frame, and looked at Arthur the way a man looks at a candle in a dark corridor — not to see by, but to know that light exists.

He left.

The door closed. The studio held its silence. The portraits watched from the walls — four hundred and seventeen pairs of eyes, each one almost, each one close, each one carrying a fraction of the thing Arthur was learning to see, the thing his charcoal was approaching the way a man approaches the truth: not in a line, not in a leap, but in the slow accretion of failed attempts, each failure a millimeter closer, each millimeter a minor resurrection of what his theory had buried.

Arthur looked at the baker from Marseille. At her left eye. The one that was closer.

He picked up the charcoal.

His hand was still shaking.

He drew anyway.
