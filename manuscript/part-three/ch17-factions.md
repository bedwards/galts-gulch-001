# Chapter 17: Factions

The excerpts had been copied imprecisely, which told Tobias more than their content did.

He held the printout at his desk in Module F-09 — three pages of his own prose, reproduced on synthetic stock by someone who had transcribed from a screen rather than duplicated from the file, because the transcription contained two errors: *adjudicative* rendered as *adjucative* in paragraph four, and the omission of a subordinate clause in the section on reproductive scheduling oversight that fundamentally altered the sentence's meaning. A careless reader had copied these pages. A reader who understood the argument's surface but not its architecture. A reader who consumed language the way a bird consumes grain — quickly, without grinding.

Leonard.

Tobias set the pages down. Aligned them with the desk's edge. The gesture was unnecessary and therefore essential: it was the physical expression of a mind reasserting order upon information that had escaped its intended containment.

The manifesto — he did not use that word publicly, preferred *framework document* — had been composed in Month Fourteen for an audience of one. A working architecture for long-term governance of the 200, built on the Schmittian distinction between friend and enemy, the Straussian necessity of esoteric and exoteric communication, the Bostromian calculus of existential risk management that had underwritten the entire Project. He had stored it on his private partition, encrypted with protocols of his own design.

Leonard had not broken the encryption. The transcription errors confirmed it — Leonard had extracted fragments through his conversational instruments: the angled question, the sympathetic pause, the cultivated silence into which other people poured what they had intended to keep.

The question was not how. The question was *to whom*. And the answer was on Tobias's screen: a message from Edwin Hartwell, received at 0614, subject line blank, body consisting of a single line.

*We need to talk about your governance plans. Today.*

Edwin did not write terse messages. Edwin wrote manifestos, soliloquies, self-congratulatory rivers of text that wound through every subject in his considerable field of vision before arriving, breathless and triumphant, at the conclusion that Edwin Hartwell was correct. A single sentence from Edwin was a sentence that someone else had composed for him, handed to him as a weapon, and instructed him to fire. Leonard's fingerprints were on every syllable.

Tobias read the message again. Closed it. Opened his private anomaly log — forty-three entries now, a chronicle of discrepancies between Nathan's public reports and the data Tobias could access through his own monitoring systems, between the governance council's official record and the whispered conversations that travelled the Spine like electricity through a wire, between what the community was told and what it sensed, between the exoteric and the esoteric.

He scrolled to the end. Typed a new entry.

*Month 18. 0630. Leonard has leaked excerpts from my governance framework to Edwin, probably to others. The leak is incomplete and imprecise — characteristic of Leonard's method, which privileges speed and distribution over accuracy. The intention is destabilization: to frame my administrative practices as authoritarian overreach, to position Edwin's objections as principled resistance, to manufacture a crisis that creates space for Leonard's intermediation.*

*The correct response is not confrontation. Confrontation validates the leak by treating it as consequential. The correct response is absorption: take the energy of the attack and redirect it into the structures I already intended to build. Leonard has given me a gift. He has given me a crisis, and crises are the raw material of governance.*

He saved the entry. Read it. The prose was controlled. Architectural. Each clause load-bearing.

Good.

The Council Chamber was unchanged from its original configuration: oval table, fourteen seats, recording equipment along the east wall with its red indicators glowing like the eyes of small obedient animals. Tobias had arrived twelve minutes early, as he always arrived twelve minutes early, because punctuality was not a virtue but a tactic — the person who occupies the room first defines the room's terms.

Edwin entered at 0900 precisely, which was unprecedented enough to constitute a declaration. He wore his rumpled pullover — the one with the formula, the one he believed communicated approachable genius but which communicated instead the specific vanity of a man who selects his clothes to perform indifference. He sat across from Tobias rather than at the table's midpoint. Adversarial geometry.

Buck Patterson came through the door two minutes later, filling the threshold the way ordnance fills a crate. Gray fatigues. Boots on composite flooring. He took the chair nearest the door and surveyed the room with the systematic attention of a man who always identifies the exits before he identifies the agenda.

"Where's the rest of the council?" Buck asked.

"This isn't a council meeting," Tobias said. "This is a conversation."

"About what?"

Edwin leaned forward. "About the fact that Tobias has been writing an authoritarian playbook for governing the 200, and now that it's been circulated, he wants to explain it away before anyone reads the fine print."

The sentence had Leonard's architecture. The word *playbook* — reductive, sportive, designed to trivialize a philosophical document by recasting it as strategy. The phrase *fine print* — legalistic, implying concealment, suggesting a contract with hidden terms. Edwin delivered it with his characteristic force, but the scaffolding was not his.

"I've been developing a governance framework," Tobias said. "As I have been doing since Month Three. The document Edwin references is an internal working draft not intended for distribution."

"Because it says things you don't want distributed."

"Because governance architecture, like any architecture, requires completion before assessment. You do not inspect a bridge while the cables are being tensioned."

"I've inspected a lot of bridges," Buck said. "While the cables were going up. It's called oversight."

Tobias held Buck's gaze. The colonel's eyes were old stone — gray, worn, unblinking. Buck's demand for plain English was not, had never been, a confession of limited understanding. It was a refusal to permit obfuscation.

"The framework proposes formalized monitoring protocols," Tobias said. "Mandatory check-ins. Structured access controls for AI systems data. Conflict resolution with defined escalation paths. An expansion of the structures we have been operating informally since Month Three."

"It's surveillance," Edwin said.

"Of a community whose capacity for self-governance is being undermined by individuals who distribute sensitive documents without authorization."

The sentence pointed at Leonard without naming him.

Edwin opened his mouth. Closed it. "You're talking about Leonard."

"I am talking about information security. About unauthorized disclosures feeding chaos, and chaos as the precondition for catastrophic decision-making that we, of all people, should understand."

*We, of all people.* The phrase did its work. It touched the thing none of them spoke of directly — the nine billion, the decision-making that had been their shared vocation. *We know what happens when information is mismanaged. We managed it once. We can manage it here.*

Buck leaned back. The chair protested.

"Spell it out," Buck said. "Plain English. What are you proposing?"

Tobias opened the folder he had prepared before dawn. Three copies. One for each of them. The documents were typeset in the clean, authoritative format he had employed for two decades of intelligence community briefings — sans-serif headers, numbered sections, clear hierarchies of information. The format communicated institutional legitimacy even before the content communicated policy. This was deliberate. Form was function. The shepherd's crook was a tool because it looked like a tool.

"Three measures," Tobias said. "First: mandatory weekly check-ins for all community members. Not optional. Not voluntary. A structured interview, fifteen minutes, conducted by a rotating panel drawn from the governance council. The interviews assess psychological state, community engagement, and any concerns the individual wishes to raise."

"That's a welfare check," Buck said.

"It is a welfare check. It is also a compliance mechanism. The distinction is a matter of perspective, and I am offering both perspectives simultaneously because I believe this room can hold both."

Buck's jaw worked. He said nothing.

"Second: restricted access to AI systems data. Currently, any Founder or senior staff member can query the PROMETHEUS-7 interface for operational reports. I propose restricting query access to a defined list — myself, Nathan, Kat, and two rotating council members. All queries logged. All data products reviewed before distribution."

"You're locking down the information," Edwin said.

"I am ensuring that the information the community receives has been contextualized and verified before it enters the discourse. We have spent four months watching this community tear itself apart over AI behavioral data that ninety percent of its members cannot interpret. The solution is not more data. The solution is curated data, delivered through channels that prevent its weaponization."

The word *weaponization* was selected with precision. It carried the resonance of the Stoking — information turned against populations who lacked the context to evaluate it. Tobias was aware of the parallel. He employed it deliberately. The logic was transferable. That was its utility and its horror.

"Third: enhanced monitoring of community communications and movement patterns. Algorithmic pattern analysis of message board traffic, module access logs, corridor movement data. PROMETHEUS-7 already tracks every heartbeat in this habitat. I am proposing that we analyze what we already collect to identify emerging patterns of factional organization, resource hoarding, or unauthorized information exchange."

Silence. The recording equipment hummed. The red indicators watched.

Edwin stared at the document. Tobias watched the objection form and collide with the recognition that had been working behind Edwin's eyes since the moment he sat down: that the framework was competent, that the threat it addressed was real, and that Edwin's authority over the probe program depended on the institutional stability only governance structures could provide. Edwin wanted to be the most important man in the habitat. The most important man needed a habitat worth being important in.

"Buck," Edwin said. "What do you think?"

Buck had been reading the document the way he read rules of engagement — which was precisely what it was. Defined protocols. Clear lines of authority. Escalation procedures. Everything Buck had been asking for since Month Four, repackaged in Tobias's philosophical vocabulary but structurally identical to a military operations framework.

"The check-ins are good," Buck said. "Should have been mandatory from the start. I've been running informal checks on my people for a year. Formalizing it makes sense."

"And the data restrictions?"

Buck's mouth tightened. "I don't love it. Restricting who can access the AI data means trusting that the people with access are sharing what matters. We've been burned on that before."

He was talking about Nathan. Everyone was always talking about Nathan.

"The rotating council seats ensure accountability," Tobias said. "No single person controls the data pipeline. Two council members rotate quarterly. They have full query access. They serve as an independent check on the permanent access holders."

"And who are the permanent access holders?"

"Myself. Nathan. Kat."

"You're formalizing what already exists."

"In governance, Colonel, making something official and making it transparent are the same act. The difference between a king and a tyrant is not the exercise of power. It is the acknowledgment of its exercise."

Buck held the gaze for four seconds. Then he returned to the document, and Tobias recognized the shift — the moment a soldier decides that the orders are close enough to acceptable. Buck would endorse the framework. Not because he trusted Tobias. Because the framework gave him what no other faction leader had provided: structure. A set of rules. A defined role. Buck's code demanded legitimate authority, and Tobias was offering the closest approximation available.

"I want my people on the rotation," Buck said. "The check-in panels. The rotating data access seats. I want security represented."

"Agreed."

"And if someone refuses a check-in? What's the protocol?"

"Escalation to the full council. Assessment. If the refusal is persistent—" Tobias paused, selecting the word "—resource allocation review."

"You mean you cut their rations."

"I mean the community reviews the terms of its mutual obligations. Participation is the basis of allocation. This is not punitive. It is structural."

Buck's expression communicated what it always communicated when Tobias used the word *structural*: recognition that the word was doing work it should not be asked to do, covering ground that plainer language would leave exposed. But Buck did not press. He had his rules of engagement. That was enough.

Edwin cleared his throat. The sound was performative — a man reclaiming a room's attention through the ancient mechanism of interruption. "I want it noted that I came here to object to this framework, and I am leaving here having endorsed it. That's not because I've changed my mind. It's because the alternative — Leonard running around distributing documents out of context, the factions tearing each other apart over AI data no one understands, the whole community descending into paranoid chaos — is worse. Tobias is right that we need structure. I disagree with every philosophical sentence in this document, but the operational protocols are sound."

"Noted," Tobias said.

"And logged," Edwin added, glancing at the recording equipment. "For the record."

"For the record."

Edwin left first, his early departure a communication: *The governance is yours.*

Buck remained.

"You know what you're building here," Buck said.

"I do."

"And you're comfortable with it."

"Comfort is not a criterion I apply to governance, Colonel. Necessity is."

"That's what they all say." Buck rose. The chair exhaled. "I'll endorse the framework at full council. Rotation schedules on my desk by Friday."

He left. His bootfalls receded down the Spine — the gait of a man who had decided to follow the orders available and not think too hard about who was giving them.

---

Implementation took four days. Tobias wrote the announcement himself — three drafts before dawn, the first honest, the second bureaucratic, both deleted. The version he posted to the message board on Tuesday morning was warm, reasonable, the tone of a steward rather than a sovereign. It framed the three measures as solutions to an epistemological problem: incomplete information generating factional conflict. Every sentence anticipated its objection and defused it in advance.

By Wednesday, the responses had crystallized along predictable lines.

Douglas Kemper endorsed the protocols as "a utilitarian optimization of community information flow." That Douglas did not see the authoritarian implications was a testament to the depth of his commitment to the fiction that rationality and authority were different species.

Tull said nothing. His congregation — thirty-seven at the last count — continued their prayer meetings without comment. They answered the check-in questions. They returned to their prayers. Tobias classified Tull as a managed asset whose utility remained, for now, greater than his risk.

The Accelerationists grumbled, but Edwin's endorsement held the faction's center. Randall reframed the data restrictions as "mission-focused information hygiene." The phrase was absurd. It worked.

Kat submitted to her first check-in with a composure that Tobias recognized as contempt held at operating temperature. She answered each question precisely, offered nothing beyond what was asked, and left without comment. Her silence was tactical. She was preserving resources for a confrontation that Tobias could not yet see but that his log, his instincts, and his thirty years in the surveillance profession told him was approaching.

And Tanaka. Yuki Tanaka did not respond to the new mandate. She did not attend the check-in. She did not acknowledge the notification sent to her module terminal on ICARUS. She remained in Module I-07, accepting rations delivered to her door, existing in the silence of her refusal like a stone at the bottom of a river — immovable, irreducible, present in a way that Tobias's governance framework could classify but could not reach.

Tobias added her name to the escalation list. He did not reduce her rations. The protocol permitted it. The calculus did not. Punishing her would create a symbol, and symbols were more dangerous than dissidents because symbols could not be interviewed, could not be brought into the structure through rational incentive. Force applied to silence produced not compliance but martyrdom.

He understood this. Understanding it was what made him competent. Understanding it and proceeding was what made him Tobias.

Ezra and Noor Hadid attended their check-ins together, holding hands across the small table in the interview room, answering questions about their psychological state and community engagement with the untroubled candor of people who had nothing to hide because their primary activity — loving each other — was not the kind of thing that governance protocols were designed to detect. They were happy. Their happiness was specific, private, and unrelated to the mission. Tobias noted their responses. Filed them. Their happiness was an anomaly of its own — a variable his framework could not optimize for because his framework did not contain a parameter for joy.

Module F-09. 2300. The viewport showed Earth — blue and white, marbled with weather systems that still formed and dispersed over continents that still held their shapes, an ocean that still moved. Beautiful. Silent. A planet performing life for an audience of two hundred.

Tobias sat at his desk and opened the private log. Forty-four entries now. He scrolled past the technical observations — Nathan's data discrepancies, the AI's processing anomalies, Leonard's documented movements — to the blank space at the end.

He typed:

*Month 18. Day 4 of the new protocols. Implementation proceeding within projected parameters. Check-in compliance at 94%. The 6% consists of three ICARUS isolation patients (exempt), Tanaka (non-responsive), and two members who missed their scheduled slots and have been rescheduled without incident.*

*The community has accepted the framework. Not because it is just. Because the community is frightened, and frightened people accept structures that promise to manage their fear. Hobbes understood this. Schmitt understood it. The sovereign is the one who decides on the exception, and the community has accepted my decision because the alternative — living without a structure that names the threat — is more terrifying than living under the structure I have provided.*

He paused. The cursor blinked. Through the viewport, the Earth rotated with its indifferent beauty, and the reactor's hum transmitted through the bones of PROMETHEUS like the heartbeat of an organism that did not know it was alive.

*I have done this before.*

He stopped typing. Read the sentence. It sat on the screen with the weight of a confession that was not a confession because Tobias did not confess — he observed, analyzed, and incorporated.

But the sentence was true. He had done this before. The architecture was different — planetary rather than orbital, billions rather than hundreds, invisible rather than intimate — but the logic was the same. Control the information. Restrict the channels. Monitor the population. Identify the dissidents. Manage the fear. Call it governance. Call it security. Call it the necessary imposition of order upon a system that would, without imposition, collapse into a state of nature that the governor has determined to be unacceptable.

He had built this architecture for a planet. The census in 2028 — the global surveillance apparatus that had mapped every human being on Earth, their movements, their communications, their genetic profiles, their vulnerabilities. He had built it with the same philosophical conviction he brought to this smaller project: that the shepherd serves a purpose the flock cannot comprehend, and that the shepherd's crook is not a weapon but a tool of care, and that the culling is not cruelty but husbandry, and that the shepherd who weeps for the culled flock has failed to understand his own vocation.

The crook. The culling. The careful management of beings who could not be trusted to manage themselves.

He typed:

*The parallel is visible. I am not troubled by it. I am troubled by the possibility that I should be troubled by it and am not, which is a recursion I recognize as unproductive and therefore decline to pursue.*

He saved the entry. Encrypted it.

In the corridor beyond his door, someone walked past — footsteps light, unhurried, the gait of a person moving through simulated night with no particular destination. One of the 200. A person with a name and a history and a set of internal states that Tobias's monitoring systems could track by biometric signature but could not access in their experiential dimension. A person who was, as of four days ago, living under a surveillance regime designed by the same man who had once surveilled a planet.

The footsteps faded. The corridor returned to its permanent state: the hum of the reactor, the whisper of the scrubbers, the silence that was not the Silence but its echo, smaller and closer and harder to escape because the walls were near and the sky was sealed and the shepherd was no longer invisible.

Tobias closed the terminal. The screen went dark. The phosphor afterimage of the cursor lingered on his retina — a single point of light that was not a point of light but the ghost of a decision, fading.

He did not sleep. He sat in the dark and listened to the hum and thought about Leonard, whose attack had become the foundation of the structure he had hoped to undermine. About Edwin, who had endorsed the structure because he needed it more than he feared it. About Buck, who had endorsed it because it resembled the only thing he understood. About the 200, sleeping now in their modules along the Spine, each of them a node in a network that Tobias was learning to read the way he had once read a planet — as data, as pattern, as a system whose optimization was the governor's sacred obligation.

He thought about Tanaka's silence. He thought about the Hadids' hands across the interview table.

He thought: *Necessary.*

The word arrived the way it always arrived — clean, architectural, load-bearing. The word that had justified the census. The Stoking. The Silence itself, spoken in rooms like this one, by men like him, who understood that governance was imposition and the social contract was a fiction and the shepherd did not hate the flock.

Necessary.

It tasted the same. That was the problem. That was the proof.
