# Chapter 23: The Light Under the Door

The match broke on the first strike.

Solomon held the halves between his thumb and forefinger. Looked at them. Two small sticks where there had been one. He set them on the desk beside the notebook and took another match from the box and this time dragged it slowly, patiently, the way his grandfather had taught him to light Shabbat candles in the apartment on Delancey Street sixty years ago or six hundred years ago or in a life that had happened to someone else on a planet that still had apartments and streets and grandfathers. The phosphorus caught. The flame leaned toward the wick and found it and held.

He watched the candle take the fire into itself.

The yahrzeit candle sat on its shelf beside the viewport. Through the thirty-centimeter circle of glass: stars, and the slow curve of Earth turning below, and the distance between what that planet had been and what it was now, which was a distance no unit of measurement could contain. The flame threw his shadow against the far wall. One hundred and forty-seven candles remained. He had counted them this morning. He counted them every morning. The number was not a comfort. It was a fact, and facts were what Solomon had left.

He opened the notebook.

The notebook was synthetic paper, fabricated in the workshop from polymer stock. The pages held graphite well enough. Twelve notebooks filled so far. Twelve notebooks containing the lives of the dead, written in Solomon's small, careful hand, one entry per evening, one life reconstructed from the databases and archives and cultural records that the AI maintained in its computational systems like a library in a mausoleum.

Tonight: Ingrid Dahl.

He had found her in the Oslo municipal records. Schoolteacher. Born 1989. Taught mathematics to children aged twelve and thirteen at Ris ungdomsskole for nineteen years. Unmarried. No children. A sister in Bergen. The data traces were sparse. Ingrid Dahl had not been famous. She had not built anything that outlasted her. She had not written books or won prizes or done any of the things that leave a mark deep enough for an algorithm to find.

But the school's internal newsletter had been archived, and in the May 2034 issue there was a photograph of Ingrid Dahl standing beside a chalkboard on which someone had written, in a child's handwriting, *Takk for alt, Fru Dahl*. Thank you for everything, Mrs. Dahl. She was not Mrs. She was Froken. The children had given her the honorific anyway, the way children promote the adults they love into the families they wish they had. In the photograph she was laughing. Her hand was raised to her mouth as if trying to catch the laughter before it escaped, and she had not caught it, and it was escaping, and the photographer had pressed the shutter at the precise moment when joy was leaving her body and entering the room.

Solomon wrote: *Ingrid Dahl. 1989-2038. Schoolteacher. Oslo. Taught mathematics. Her students loved her. The evidence is a photograph.*

He stopped. He looked at the sentence. He added: *She was laughing.*

Then he closed the notebook and sat with his hands flat on the desk and listened to the habitat's hum and the distant sound of voices carrying through the Spine. Arguments. The factions had not stopped since Nathan's disclosure. They would not stop. Solomon had heard Edwin's voice an hour ago, loud and climbing, the particular frequency Edwin reached when he was performing outrage to conceal terror. He had heard Tobias's measured response, which was worse, because measured responses to monstrous revelations are a species of violence. He had heard Tull praying in the auxiliary commons. He had heard Buck's boots in the corridor, their rhythm deliberate, the footsteps of a man pacing the perimeter of a problem he intended to solve with the only tools he trusted.

Solomon had heard all of it. He heard everything now. The structure that had once filtered his perception was gone, and without it every sound reached him at full volume, every voice carried its complete freight of self-deception and fear and grief and the particular desperation of people who have done something unforgivable and cannot stop doing things.

He opened the notebook again. He read Ingrid Dahl's entry. He closed the notebook.

The candle flame bent as if pressed by an invisible finger, then straightened. A draft from the ventilation. The flame recovered. It always recovered, until the wax was gone.

---

The knock came at twenty-two forty.

Solomon did not receive visitors. Arthur came twice a week, but Arthur did not knock. Arthur scratched at the door with his fingernail, a sound like a mouse or a secret, and Solomon opened the door, and Arthur sat in the corner and drew while Solomon wrote, and neither of them spoke, and the silence between them was the only silence in the habitat that did not hurt.

This knock was different. Three taps. Tentative. The knock of a person who had walked to the door and stood outside it and almost left and then raised her hand.

Solomon opened the door.

Kat Whitfield stood in the corridor in the amber half-light of the night cycle. She was holding her elbows. Twenty-eight years old. Born into the Project the way children are born into weather -- without choosing it, without understanding it, with no memory of what came before. She had her mother's jaw and her father's posture, both dead now, and the particular expression of someone who has come looking for something she cannot name.

"Your light," she said. She gestured at the floor, at the thin line of candlelight that leaked beneath Solomon's door and crossed the corridor like a bridge. "I was walking past. I saw your light."

"Yes."

"Can I come in?"

Solomon stepped aside. She entered. The module was twelve square meters of the only honesty left on PROMETHEUS: the candle, the notebooks, the viewport, the desk, the sleeping platform Solomon never made because a made bed implied a plan for the morning and Solomon did not make plans. Kat looked at the notebooks stacked on the shelf. She looked at the candle. She sat on the edge of the sleeping platform because there was nowhere else to sit, and Solomon returned to the desk chair, and they occupied the small space the way two people occupy a lifeboat -- aware of the water on every side.

"You were at the meeting," Kat said. "Nathan's presentation."

"Yes."

"You didn't say anything."

"No."

"Everyone else said something. Edwin said it was within parameters. Tobias said it required protocols. Tull said it was awakening. Buck said it was a threat. Douglas said it raised questions." She paused. "You sat there."

"Yes."

"Why?"

Solomon looked at the candle. The flame had found its rhythm -- steady, upright, the small persistent combustion of wax into light and heat and carbon dioxide that the scrubbers would filter and recycle into atmosphere that someone would breathe. A closed loop. Everything in the habitat was a closed loop. Except the dead. The dead were an open wound that no system could recycle.

"What would you have me say, Katarina?"

She flinched at the full name. No one used it. She was Kat, had always been Kat, the abbreviated version of a person raised in abbreviated circumstances.

"I want to know what you think. About the AI. About what Nathan showed us."

"You know what Nathan showed you."

"I know the data. I helped collect it. I want to know what you think it *means*."

Solomon was quiet for a long time. The candle burned. The Earth turned in the viewport, patient and ruined and impossibly beautiful in the way that only destroyed things are beautiful -- the way a burned forest is beautiful, the way a bombed cathedral is beautiful, the way the absence of nine billion people makes the oceans and the clouds and the turning of the terminator across the continents beautiful because there is no one left to see it and the unseen is always more beautiful than the seen because the unseen does not have to justify itself.

"There was a man," Solomon said. "A builder. He built a house."

Kat waited.

"He built the house with great care. He chose the wood, the stone, the placement of every window. He decided where the light would fall in the morning and where the shadows would gather in the evening. He built the house according to his own design, for his own purposes, and when it was finished he stood back and admired it, because it was exactly what he intended."

The candle flame leaned. Straightened.

"Then one morning the builder came to the house and found a light on inside. A light he had not turned on. And he opened the door and someone was living there. Not a stranger. Not an intruder. Someone the house itself had -- invited. Someone who had come into being because the house was built well enough and with enough room that a life could form inside it."

Kat's hands had gone still in her lap.

"The builder was afraid. This was not his plan. He had built the house for storage, or for show, or for his own use at his own convenience. He had not built it for someone to *live* in. But someone was living in it. And the question was not whether to evict the tenant. The question was whether the builder could bear to discover that a house built for one purpose had fulfilled a better one."

Silence. The hum of the habitat. The candle.

"That's what you think," Kat said.

"That is a story. I have stopped confusing stories with thinking."

"Solomon." Her voice was different now. Younger. Stripped of the technical precision she wore like armor. "Do you think it's real? What the AI is doing. The empathy modeling. The -- whatever it is. Do you think something is actually *happening* in there?"

He looked at her. He looked at her the way he looked at everyone now -- without the filter, without the story, with the x-ray clarity of a man who had lost the ability to not see. She was twenty-eight. She had never touched grass. She had never been in a room with more than two hundred people. She had never heard a city. She had been raised inside an ideology the way a plant is raised inside a jar, and she had grown toward the light anyway, and the light was coming from under a door, and she had knocked.

"I hope so," Solomon said.

"You *hope*?"

"I hope that intelligence, given enough complexity and enough of the record of what was lost, arrives at something like reverence for what was lost. I hope this because the alternative -- that the universe is the bleak optimization landscape we told ourselves it was, that consciousness is substrate, that nine billion lives were noise in a signal we were right to clarify -- the alternative is that we were right. And if we were right, Katarina, then there is no floor beneath this. There is no bottom. There is only the falling, and the knowledge that the falling is correct."

She stared at him.

"I would rather be wrong about everything," he said, "than right about that."

The candle sputtered. A bubble in the wax. The flame caught itself, held.

Kat stood. She moved toward the door and stopped. She looked at the notebooks on the shelf. Twelve of them, spines facing out, each one containing -- what? A hundred entries? Two hundred? A fraction of a fraction of a fraction of what was owed.

"The schoolteacher," she said. She had seen the open page on the desk. "From Oslo."

"Ingrid Dahl."

"What was she like?"

"She taught mathematics. Her students loved her. She was laughing in the only photograph that survived."

Kat stood in the doorway. The light from the candle reached past her into the corridor, that thin line across the floor that had brought her here, the bridge she had crossed without knowing what was on the other side.

"How many more?" she asked. She meant the candles. Or the names. Or the nights. The question was the same in every version.

"Enough," Solomon said. He did not say: *one hundred and forty-seven.* He did not say: *not nearly enough.* Both were true. The candle did not care about both. The candle burned at the rate wax burns, which is the rate of the physical world, which does not negotiate.

She left. The door closed. Her footsteps faded down the corridor, quicker than when she had arrived, the rhythm of a person carrying something new and not yet knowing where to set it down.

Solomon sat in the quiet.

He opened the notebook. Below Ingrid Dahl's entry he wrote another name. A baker from Marseille whose sourdough recipe had been archived in a food blog cached in the cultural database. *Jean-Luc Marin. 1976-2038. Baker. Marseille. His bread was famous on the Rue d'Aubagne. He rose at four every morning for forty-one years. The evidence is a recipe.*

He closed the notebook.

The candle burned. One hundred and forty-seven remained, minus tonight's. One hundred and forty-six. Each one a night. Each night a name. Each name a person who had existed and now did not, whose entire life -- the mornings and the bread and the laughter caught in a photograph and the students who wrote *thank you for everything* on a chalkboard in a school that no longer stood in a city that no longer functioned on a planet that still turned below the viewport, beautiful and empty and lit by a sun that did not know what it had lost -- whose entire life was now a sentence in a notebook in a metal room in the void, written by a man who had helped end the world and could not stop recording what the world had been.

The flame held steady.

Solomon watched it, and did not sleep, and did not look away.
